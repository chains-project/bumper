# Bumper: Automatic Program Repair For Breaking Dependency Updates With Large Language Models

External libraries are widely used to expedite software development, but like any software component, they are updated
over time, introducing new features and deprecating or removing old ones. When a library introduces breaking changes,
all its clients must be updated to avoid disruptions. This update, when it introduces a breaking change, is defined as a
Breaking Dependency Update. Repairing such breakages is challenging and time-consuming because the error originates in
the dependency, while the fix must be applied to the client codebase.

Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a research area focused on developing techniques to repair code failures without human
intervention. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), learning-based APR techniques have significantly improved
in software repair tasks. However, their effectiveness on Breaking Dependency Updates remains unexplored.

Bumper is APR for breaking dependency updates with LLMs.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chains-project/bumper.git
    cd bumper
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Setup benchmarks dataset:
   ```shell
   bash setup.bash
   ```

5. Setup environment variable:
   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. **To use Gemini you need to store the Google Cloud API Credential `(g_credentials.json)` in the root folder of the
   project**:

## Usage

### Run all the experiments

1. To run the complete experiment set in sequence:
    ```sh
    bash run_experiments.bash :name
    ```

2. Or to run the complete experiment set in parallel (4 processes max):
   ```sh
   bash run_experiments-parallel.bash :name
   ```

### Run a specific experiment

To run a specific experiment you can use the `benchmark.py` script with the needed flags.

 ```sh
 [RUN_ID=:id] [WITHOUT_APIDIFF=True] python benchmark.py -n :name -p :pipeline -m :model
 ```

**IMPORTANT:** To run multiple experiments in parallel remember to set the `RUN_ID` env variable to identify the
specific execution and avoid collisions in the repair process

## Results

The results of our experiments can be found in the `results` directory.
A complete data analysis with chart is provided in the [analysis](results%2Fanalysis.ipynb) Jupyter notebook
Key findings include:

- The necessity of incorporating additional context from dependency changes.
- The importance of error-type specific repair strategies.
- Comparative analysis of GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama in terms of efficacy and cost-efficiency.

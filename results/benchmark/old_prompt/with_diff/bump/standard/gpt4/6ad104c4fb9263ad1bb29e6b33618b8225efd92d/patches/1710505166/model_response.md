The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This means that the import statement is trying to import a package that is not available in the new version of the library.

A direct fix would be to import the correct package that's available in the new version of the library. However, without knowing the exact structure of the new version of the library, it's impossible to provide a direct replacement for the import statement.

It's also important to note that the methods `TlsFatalAlert` and `getAlertDescription()` from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert` class have been removed in the new version of the library. This means that if these methods are used in the client code, they need to be replaced with alternative methods that provide the same functionality.

Without knowing the exact structure of the new version of the library and the complete client code, it's impossible to provide a direct replacement for these methods.

However, a general approach to fix this issue would be to:

1. Identify the new package that provides the same or similar functionality as the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package.
2. Import this new package.
3. Identify the new methods that provide the same or similar functionality as the `TlsFatalAlert` and `getAlertDescription()` methods.
4. Replace the usage of the `TlsFatalAlert` and `getAlertDescription()` methods with these new methods.

Without the necessary information, it's impossible to provide a specific code patch. However, the general approach described above should guide you in fixing the issue.

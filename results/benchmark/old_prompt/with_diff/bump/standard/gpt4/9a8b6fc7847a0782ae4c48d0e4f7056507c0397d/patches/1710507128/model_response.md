The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. This is due to the removal of the `PasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package in the new library version.

Unfortunately, without the addition of a replacement class or method in the library update notes, it's impossible to provide a direct replacement for the removed functionality.

However, you can use the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder` from Spring Security as an alternative. This class provides similar functionality to the removed `PasswordEncoder`.

Here's how you can replace the import statement:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
```

Please note that you may need to adjust your code to use this new `PasswordEncoder` class, as the methods it provides may not be identical to those of the removed `PasswordEncoder` class.

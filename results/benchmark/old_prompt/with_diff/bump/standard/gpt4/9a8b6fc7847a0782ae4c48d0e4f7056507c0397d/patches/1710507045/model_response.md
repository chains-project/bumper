The error message states that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. Further, the library changes indicate that all methods from `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` and `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` have been removed. Without the addition of new methods or classes, it's impossible to provide a patch for the client code that uses these removed classes or methods. 

For a proper solution, it's necessary to know what new methods or classes have been added to the library. With the current information, the only possible solution would be to use a different library or to implement the password encoding and validation functionality manually. 

However, without knowing the specific project requirements and constraints, it's not possible to provide a suitable code patch.

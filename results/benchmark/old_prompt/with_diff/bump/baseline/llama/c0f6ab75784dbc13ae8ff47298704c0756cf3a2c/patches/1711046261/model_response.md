Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(LanguageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```
In this patch, we replaced `globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages()` with `LanguageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode()`, which is a new method added in the updated library version. This method provides the same functionality as the removed `getEnabledLanguages()` method, but with a different signature.

We also removed the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary in this case.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

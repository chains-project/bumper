Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument named `s`, and returns `true` if the `s` contains the expected string.

The reason for this failure is that the `StringContains` constructor that takes two `String` arguments has been removed in the new version of the library. The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error.

This patch can be applied to the code in order to fix the error, and it does not require any other changes to the code.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image // change here
    );
}
```
The error was caused by passing a boolean value as the second argument to the `StringContains` constructor, which expects a `java.lang.String`. To fix this, we removed the `String.format` method call and replaced it with a concatenation operator (`+`) to combine the string literals.

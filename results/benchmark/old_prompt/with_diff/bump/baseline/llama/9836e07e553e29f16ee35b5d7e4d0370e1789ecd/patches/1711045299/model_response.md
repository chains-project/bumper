Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and checks if it contains the expected string.

The `StringContains` constructor that takes two arguments is used instead of the one that takes a single `String` argument, to avoid the error message about the wrong number of arguments.

The `Override` decorator is not needed, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
The patch uses the `String.format` method to format the string as before, but with the image name included.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

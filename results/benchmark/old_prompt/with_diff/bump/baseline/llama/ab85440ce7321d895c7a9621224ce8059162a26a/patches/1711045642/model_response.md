Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        String pulledImage = String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
        return new StringContains(pulledImage, pulledImage);
    }
```
The patch creates a new `String` variable `pulledImage` that contains the formatted string, and then passes that variable to the `StringContains` constructor. This resolves the error by providing a `String` argument to the constructor, rather than a `boolean` and a `String`.

Additionally, the `String.format` method is used to format the message, which is more concise and easier to read than concatenating strings.

This patch does not modify the function signature, and it uses only the `StringContains` class from the hamcrest library, which is available in the new version. Therefore, it should fix the error and make the test pass.

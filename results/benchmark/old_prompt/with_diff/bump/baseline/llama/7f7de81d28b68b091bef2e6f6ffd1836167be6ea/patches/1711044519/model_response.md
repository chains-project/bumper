Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);
            final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            // registry.set(server, reg); // this line is not needed, the field is already set
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
        }
    }
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` had a different type than the `SortedMap` used in the code.

The fix is to remove the `registry.set(server, reg);` line, as it is not needed, and the field is already set by the `reg.put()` method.

Additionally, the `MOScope` and `ManagedObject` types have been updated to match the new library version.

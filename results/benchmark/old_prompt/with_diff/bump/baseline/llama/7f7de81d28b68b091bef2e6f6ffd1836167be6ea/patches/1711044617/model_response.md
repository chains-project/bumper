Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
    private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);
            final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            // registry.set(server, reg);  // remove this line
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
        }
    }
```
The error message indicates that the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` cannot be converted to `java.util.SortedMap<org.snmp4j.agent.MOScope, org.snmp4j.agent.ManagedObject>`.


The issue is that the `getRegistry()` method has been modified in the new version of the library to return a `SortedMap` with different generic types than the ones used in the client code.


To fix the issue, we can remove the line `registry.set(server, reg);` as it is not needed and it is causing the compatibility issue.

The `registry` field is already being set accessible, so we can directly use the `reg` variable to put the `MOGroup` instance into the registry.

By removing that line, the code will not try to assign a `SortedMap` with incompatible types to the `registry` field, and the error will be fixed.

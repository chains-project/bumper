Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime()));
    return timestamp;
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `between()` method in the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime` class has been updated to return a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. To fix this, we need to modify the client code to use the updated `between()` method and convert the result to a `Timestamp`.


We first create a `java.sql.Timestamp` object from the `from` and `to` dates using the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). We then call the `between()` method from the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime` class, passing in the `Timestamp` objects for `from` and `to`. The method returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which we assign to a variable named `timestamp`.

Finally, we return the `timestamp` object, which is of type `java.sql.Timestamp`, thus fixing the type mismatch error.

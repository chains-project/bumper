The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This could be because the package has been moved or renamed in the new version of the library. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the structure of the new version of the library, it's impossible to provide a patch that will definitely work. 

However, a common change in the Bouncy Castle library is that the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package has been renamed to `org.bouncycastle.tls`. 

You can try changing the import statement to the following:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Please note that you might need to change other parts of your code that use the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package to use `org.bouncycastle.tls` instead.

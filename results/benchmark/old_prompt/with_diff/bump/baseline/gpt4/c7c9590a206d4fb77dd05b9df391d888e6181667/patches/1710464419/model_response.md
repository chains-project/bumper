The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This is because in the new library version, all the methods related to `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext` have been removed. 

However, it seems that a new method `getOutputName()` has been added to `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext`. This suggests that `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext` might be a replacement for the removed `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext`. 

Therefore, we can try replacing the import statement with `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext`:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
```

This should solve the issue if `RenderingContext` from `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `RenderingContext` from `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render`. However, please note that you might need to update other parts of your code to use the new `RenderingContext` if they were using methods from the old `RenderingContext` that have been removed in the new library version.

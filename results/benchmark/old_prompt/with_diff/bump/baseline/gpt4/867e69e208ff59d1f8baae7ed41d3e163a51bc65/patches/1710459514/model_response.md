Without knowing the changes in the new library version, it's impossible to provide an accurate solution. However, the error message indicates that the class `TFramedTransport` can't be found in the package `org.apache.thrift.transport`. 

This could be due to various reasons such as the class being moved to a different package, renamed or removed entirely in the new version of the library. 

Please provide the changes in the new library version so that I can propose a suitable patch.

The error message indicates that the method `getWildcard()` is not found in the new version of the library. The changes in the library do not list any new methods that would replace `getWildcard()`. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct replacement for this method.

However, the purpose of `getWildcard()` is typically to provide a wildcard string (such as "*" or "?") that can be used in file or directory scanning. If we can find an alternative way to provide this wildcard string, we can potentially fix the code.

Unfortunately, without more information about the `TestListResolver` class and its `getWildcard()` method, it is not possible to provide a definitive solution. 

If `getWildcard()` was simply returning a string like "*", we can directly use it in the code. Here's a potential solution if that's the case:

```java
  static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        String wildcard = "*";
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, wildcard);
        return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
    }
```

In this code, we replace `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` with a string literal "*". This assumes that the `getWildcard()` method was simply returning a string like "*". You may need to adjust this based on the actual behavior of the `getWildcard()` method.

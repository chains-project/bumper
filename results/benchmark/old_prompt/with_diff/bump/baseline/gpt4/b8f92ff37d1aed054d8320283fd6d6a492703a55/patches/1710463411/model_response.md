Based on the error message and the changes in the library, it seems that the method `getWildcard()` from the class `TestListResolver` is no longer available in the new version of the library. Unfortunately, the changes provided do not indicate a replacement for this method.

However, I can still suggest a patch to handle this situation. You can replace the direct call to `getWildcard()` with a method that provides the required functionality. Here's a sample patch:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    String wildcard = getWildcardReplacement(); // This method should be implemented to provide the required functionality
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, wildcard);
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}

private static String getWildcardReplacement() {
    // Implement this method to return the required wildcard string
    // This could involve reading from a configuration file, 
    // or using a constant value, depending on the requirements of your project
    return "*";
}
```

Please note that you will need to implement the `getWildcardReplacement()` method to return the appropriate wildcard string, as per the requirements of your project.

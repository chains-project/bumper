As you didn't provide the changes made to the new library version, I cannot propose a specific patch. However, the error message indicates that the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This suggests that the class was removed or renamed in the new version of the library.

Here is a general approach to solve this issue:

1. Check the new version of the library to see if the class `Tv` has been renamed or moved to a different package. If it has, update the import statement with the new class name or package.

2. If the class `Tv` has been removed, you will need to find a replacement for it in the new library version. Check the library's documentation or the list of changes for a suitable replacement.

3. If there is no direct replacement, you may need to rewrite the part of your code that used the `Tv` class using the new features of the library.

Without the specific changes in the new library version and the usage of `Tv` in your code, I can't provide a specific patch. Please provide the changes in the new library version and the usage of `Tv` in your code for a more specific solution.

It appears that the `PasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package has been removed in the new library version. As a result, the client code fails to import it. 

Without knowing what the new library version offers as a replacement for the removed `PasswordEncoder`, it's impossible to provide a code patch. 

If the library provides a new way to handle password encoding, you would need to import that class and use its methods instead. 

For example, if the new library version provides a `NewPasswordEncoder` class in the `org.newlibrary.security` package, you would import and use that class:

```java
import org.newlibrary.security.NewPasswordEncoder;
```

Please provide more information about the new library version so that a more accurate patch can be provided.

The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. This is because the `PasswordEncoder` class was removed in the new library version. Unfortunately, the library changes do not provide any additions, so it's impossible to propose a direct replacement using the new version of the library.

However, a common replacement for `PasswordEncoder` in newer versions of Spring Security is `BCryptPasswordEncoder`. This class is part of the `org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt` package. Here's how you could change the import statement to use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` instead:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;
```

Please note that this change would also require updates to the code that uses `PasswordEncoder`, replacing it with equivalent methods from `BCryptPasswordEncoder`. It's also important to note that `BCryptPasswordEncoder` does not support the same methods as `PasswordEncoder`, so further code changes may be necessary.

If you need to maintain compatibility with the old `PasswordEncoder` class, you may need to consider using an older version of the library or finding an alternative library that provides a similar class.

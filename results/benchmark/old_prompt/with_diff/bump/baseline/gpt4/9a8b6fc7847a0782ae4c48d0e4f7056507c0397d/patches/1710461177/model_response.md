Based on the changes in the new library version, it appears that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class and its methods have been removed. This means we cannot use it in our method anymore. However, it looks like there are no new methods or classes provided that we could use as a direct replacement. 

Therefore, in this case, we might need to use a different approach or a different library to achieve the same functionality. Unfortunately, without knowing the details of the new library version, it's not possible to provide a specific code patch. 

However, the following is a general guideline on how you might replace the `PBEPasswordEncoder` usage with a hypothetical `NewPasswordEncoder` class:

```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    byte[] password = lookupPasswordFromKeyStore();

    char[] chars = toChars(password);
    try {
        stringEncrypter = new StandardPBEStringEncryptor();
        stringEncrypter.setPasswordCharArray(chars);

        if (getProviderName() != null && !getProviderName().isEmpty()) {
            stringEncrypter.setProviderName(getProviderName());
        }
        stringEncrypter.setAlgorithm(getAlgorithm());

        // Assuming NewPasswordEncoder is a replacement for PBEPasswordEncoder
        NewPasswordEncoder encoder = new NewPasswordEncoder();
        encoder.setEncryptor(stringEncrypter);

        return encoder;
    } finally {
        scramble(password);
        scramble(chars);
    }
}
```
In this hypothetical solution, `NewPasswordEncoder` is a new class that replaces `PBEPasswordEncoder` and `setEncryptor` is a new method that replaces `setPbeStringEncryptor`. Please replace these with the actual classes and methods provided by the new library version.

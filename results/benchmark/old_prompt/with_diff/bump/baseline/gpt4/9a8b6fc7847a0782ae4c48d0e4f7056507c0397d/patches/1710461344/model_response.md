Based on the changes in the library, it seems that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class and its methods have been removed. This is causing the failure as the client code is trying to use this non-existing class. However, the library does not seem to have added any new classes or methods that could be used as a direct replacement. Therefore, without knowing the exact functionality of the removed classes and methods, it's impossible to provide a patch that would fix this error.

In a real-life scenario, I would recommend looking for an alternative library that provides similar functionality or contacting the library's authors for advice. Alternatively, you could consider downgrading to an older version of the library that still includes these classes and methods. However, please note that this could potentially expose your application to bugs and security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the newer version.

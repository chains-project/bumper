The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. This is because the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class and the `PasswordEncoder` class have been removed from the new library version. 

Therefore, without these classes and their methods, it's impossible to provide a patch that can fix the error using the new library version. 

The best course of action would be to downgrade to a previous version of the library where these classes and methods still exist. 

If downgrading is not an option, you'll need to find an alternative way to implement the functionality provided by these classes and methods, possibly by using a different library or writing custom code. 

Without more context or information on the new library version, it's impossible to provide a more specific solution.

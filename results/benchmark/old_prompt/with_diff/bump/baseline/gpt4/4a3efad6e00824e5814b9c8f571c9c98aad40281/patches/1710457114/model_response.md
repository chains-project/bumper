Based on the information provided, it seems like the class `CertificationPermission` has been removed or moved to a different package in the new library version. Without the specific changes in the library, it's hard to provide an exact solution. 

However, a general solution can be to remove the import statement and replace the usage of `CertificationPermission` with the new class or method provided in the library. If there is no direct replacement, you will need to implement the functionality that `CertificationPermission` provided using the new methods or classes in the library.

If the class `CertificationPermission` has just been moved to a different package, the fix would be to update the import statement to the new package.

Since the exact changes in the library are not provided, I can't provide a specific code fix. Please provide the changes in the library version so I can provide a more accurate solution.

The error message indicates that the class TFastFramedTransport cannot be found in the package org.apache.thrift.transport. This is because the class has been removed in the new version of the library.

The new version of the library has added the class TIOStreamTransport in the package org.apache.thrift.transport. This class should be used instead of the removed TFastFramedTransport class.

Here is the updated client code:

```java
  import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
```

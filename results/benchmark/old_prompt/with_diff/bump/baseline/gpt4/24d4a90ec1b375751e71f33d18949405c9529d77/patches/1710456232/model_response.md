Without knowing the changes in the new library version, it's impossible to provide a specific patch for the error. However, based on the error message, it seems the class `Tv` in the package `com.jcabi.aspects` is no longer available.

A possible fix would be to replace the missing class with an equivalent one from the new library version. If there is no direct equivalent, you may need to create a workaround using the available classes and methods in the new library version.

Since I don't have the details of the new library version, I can't provide a specific code. But here is a generic example of how you might replace a missing class:

```java
import com.newlibrary.NewClass;
```

In this example, `NewClass` would be a class from the new library version that provides the same or similar functionality as the missing `Tv` class from the old library version. You would need to replace any usage of `Tv` in your code with `NewClass`.

Remember to adjust the rest of your code accordingly to accommodate for the changes in the new library version.

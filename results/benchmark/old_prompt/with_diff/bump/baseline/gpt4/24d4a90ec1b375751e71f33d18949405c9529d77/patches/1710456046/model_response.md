Apologies for the confusion, but without the complete information about the changes in the new library version and the context of how the `Tv` class is used in the client code, it's not possible to provide a precise solution. 

However, if the `Tv` class is removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package in the new version, you need to find an alternative way to accomplish the same functionality that `Tv` class was providing in your client code. 

Please provide the complete details about the new library version changes and the usage of `Tv` class in your client code for more accurate help.

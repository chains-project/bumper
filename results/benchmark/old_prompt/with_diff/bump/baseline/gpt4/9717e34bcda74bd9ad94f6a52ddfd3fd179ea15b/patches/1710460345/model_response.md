It seems like the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` has been removed in the new library version. Without the specific changes in the new library version, it's hard to provide an exact code replacement. 

However, if the functionality of `Tv` class is replaced by another class in the new version, you should import and use that class instead. 

For instance, if the `Tv` class functionality is replaced by a class named `NewTv` in the same package, the corrected code would look like this:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.NewTv;
```

Please replace `NewTv` with the actual class that replaces `Tv` in your specific library version. If no such class exists, you may need to implement the functionality yourself or find an alternative library.

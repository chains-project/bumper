As per the error message, it seems that the class `Tv` is no longer available in the new version of `com.jcabi.aspects`. Without knowing the exact changes in the new library version, it's not possible to provide an exact fix.

However, the general approach would be to replace the usage of the `Tv` class with an equivalent class or method provided in the new version of the library. If this class was used for time conversions, you might need to replace it with Java's built-in time conversion methods or another third-party library.

If the `Tv` class is not replaced with a new class in the library, you might need to implement the functionality provided by this class yourself. This might involve writing a new class or method that provides the same functionality.

If you provide the changes in the new library version, I could provide a more specific fix.

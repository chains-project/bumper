As the error message states that the class `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`, it seems like the class `Tv` has been removed from the new version of the library.

However, without the information about what `Tv` class was doing in the code and what methods or functionalities it was providing, it's impossible to propose a fix or a patch. 

If the `Tv` class was just a utility class providing some helper methods, it might be possible to replace its usage with some other class or methods from the updated library or from Java standard libraries. 

If the `Tv` class was providing some specific functionalities related to the library, then we need to find out if the library provides any new classes or methods that can replace the functionalities of `Tv` class.

Without the missing information, it's impossible to provide a patch. Please provide more details about the `Tv` class and its usage in the code.

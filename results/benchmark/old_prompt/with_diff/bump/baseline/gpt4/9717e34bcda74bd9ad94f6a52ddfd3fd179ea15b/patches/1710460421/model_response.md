Based on the error message, it seems that the class `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` is no longer available in the new version of the library. Unfortunately, without the details about the changes in the new version of the library or the context of how `Tv` was used in the client code, it's impossible to suggest a concrete fix.

However, a typical way to address this could be to replace the usage of the `Tv` class with an equivalent one from the new library or from the standard Java library. 

For instance, if `Tv` was used for time management, it could be replaced with java.time classes. If it was used for mathematical operations, it could be replaced with java.lang.Math.

Please provide more details about the changes in the new version of the library and the usage of `Tv` in the client code to get a more accurate patch.

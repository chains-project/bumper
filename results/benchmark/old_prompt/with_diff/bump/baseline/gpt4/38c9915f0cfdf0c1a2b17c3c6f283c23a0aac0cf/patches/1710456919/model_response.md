The error message indicates that the import statement is incorrect, and the class, interface, or enum expected is not found. However, without the changes in the library version, it's impossible to provide a concrete solution. 

The error could be due to the class `UncheckedText` being removed, relocated, or renamed in the new version of the library. 

If the class is renamed or relocated, you should change the import statement to reflect the new name or location. If the class is removed, you should find an alternative class or method in the new library version that provides the same functionality as `UncheckedText`.

Please provide the changes in the new library version for a more accurate solution.

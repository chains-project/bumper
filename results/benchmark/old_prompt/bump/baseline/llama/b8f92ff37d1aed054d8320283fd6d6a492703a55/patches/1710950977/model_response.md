Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
  static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
        return Stream.concat(directoryScanner.scan().spliterator(), Stream.of(testSrcFolder.getAbsolutePath()))
            .filter(path -> path.endsWith(".class"))
            .map(path -> path.substring(testSrcFolder.getAbsolutePath().length() + 1))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
```
The proposed patch uses the `Stream` API to perform the same operation as the original code, but with some modifications to handle the dependency issue.

The `DirectoryScanner` class is still used to scan the directory, but instead of using the `getClasses()` method, we use the `spliterator()` method to get a stream of files in the directory. We then use the `Stream.concat()` method to concatenate the stream of files with a stream containing the absolute path of the `testSrcFolder` parameter.

The resulting stream is then filtered to only include files that end with the ".class" extension, and the `map()` method is used to remove the directory path from the file names, leaving only the class names.

Finally, the `collect()` method is used to collect the class names into a list, which is returned as the method result.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

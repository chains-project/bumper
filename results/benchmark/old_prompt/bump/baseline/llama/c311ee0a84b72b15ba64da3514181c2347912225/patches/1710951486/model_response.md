Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(true, image)
    );
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because the `StringContains` class has been updated to require a `Pattern` argument in its constructor, which is not compatible with the old `StringContains` constructor that took a `boolean` and a `String` argument.

To fix this issue, we can replace the old `StringContains` with the new `AllOf` class, which is a more powerful alternative that can handle multiple patterns. We create a new `AllOf` instance with two `StringContains` instances: one that checks for the presence of "Status: Downloaded newer image for " followed by the image name, and another that checks for the presence of the image name.

By using `AllOf`, we can keep the same logic as before but with a more modern and flexible way of expressing it.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            " Pulled"
        )
    );
}
```
The error is caused by an incompatible argument type in the constructor of `StringContains`. The `StringContains` constructor expects a `Pattern` object as its second argument, but the given string format does not compile to a valid regular expression pattern.

The proposed patch uses the `AllOf` class from the Hamcrest library to combine two `StringContains` matchers. The first `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the given image name in the output, and the second `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string " Pulled". The `AllOf` matcher ensures that both conditions must be met for the match to succeed.

This patch does not change the method signature, and it removes the `Override` decorator since it is not necessary. The `AllOf` class is available in the Hamcrest library, so it does not need to be removed.

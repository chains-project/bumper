Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            " Pulled"
        )
    );
}
```
The error was caused by trying to create a `StringContains` matcher with a `false` value for the `negate` parameter, which is not a valid constructor argument. To fix this, we've replaced the `StringContains` matcher with an `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers: one that looks for the text "Status: Downloaded newer image for" followed by the image name, and another that looks for the text " Pulled". The `AllOf` matcher will only match if both of its component matchers match, which should achieve the desired result.

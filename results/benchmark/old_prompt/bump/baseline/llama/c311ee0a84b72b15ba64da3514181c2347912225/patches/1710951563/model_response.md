Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        return new AllOf(
            new StringContains(
                false,
                String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
            ),
            new StringContains(
                false,
                " Pulled"
            )
        );
    }
```
The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because `StringContains` expects a single string argument representing the expected substring, whereas the code is passing a format string with multiple placeholders.

The proposed patch uses the `AllOf` matcher, which allows combining multiple matchers. In this case, we create two `StringContains` matchers, one for the "Status: Downloaded newer image for" prefix and another for the " Pulled" suffix. By combining these two matchers with `AllOf`, the method should now pass.

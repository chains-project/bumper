Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            false,
            "pullImage"
        )
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containing string, and the second is a `String` that represents the contained string. The error message indicates that the types of the arguments passed to the `StringContains` constructor are incompatible.

The fix is to replace the `StringContains` class with the `AllOf` class, which takes an array of `Matcher` objects as its constructor argument. The `AllOf` class returns a `Matcher` object that matches if all of the `Matcher` objects in the array match.

In this case, we create two `StringContains` objects, one that looks for the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for" followed by the image name, and another that looks for the string "pullImage". We then pass these two `StringContains` objects to the `AllOf` constructor to create a `Matcher` object that matches if both of the `StringContains` objects match.

This patch fixes the error because the `AllOf` class takes care of the type checking, and ensures that the `Matcher` objects passed to it are compatible.

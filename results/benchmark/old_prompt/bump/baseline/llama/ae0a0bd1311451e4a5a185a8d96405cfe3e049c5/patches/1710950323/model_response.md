Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        return new AllOf(
            new StringContains(
                false,
                String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
            ),
            new StringContains(
                false,
                "pullImage"
            )
        );
    }
```
The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because the `StringContains` class has been updated to require a `Pattern` argument in its constructor, which is not being passed in the code.

To fix this, we can replace the `StringContains` class with the `AllOf` class, which is a newer version of the `StringContains` class that takes a `Pattern` argument. We can create a new `AllOf` object that contains two `StringContains` objects, one for the status message and one for the pull image message. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

Note that we cannot remove the `Override` decorator because the `imagePulled` method is overriding a method in the superclass.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
protected JFrogPlatformInstance run() throws Exception {
    if (isAllBlank(step.url, step.artifactoryUrl, step.distributionUrl)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("At least one of the following is mandatory: 'url', 'artifactoryUrl', 'distributionUrl'");
    }
    String urlWithoutSlash = removeEnd(step.url, "/");
    String artifactoryUrl = defaultIfBlank(step.artifactoryUrl, urlWithoutSlash + "/" + "artifactory");
    String distributionUrl = defaultIfBlank(step.distributionUrl, urlWithoutSlash + "/" + "distribution");

    ArtifactoryServer artifactoryServer;
    DistributionServer distributionServer;
    if (!isEmpty(step.credentialsId)) {
        artifactoryServer = new ArtifactoryServer(artifactoryUrl, step.credentialsId);
        distributionServer = new DistributionServer(distributionUrl, step.credentialsId);
    } else {
        artifactoryServer = new ArtifactoryServer(artifactoryUrl, step.username, step.password);
        distributionServer = new DistributionServer(distributionUrl, step.username, step.password);
    }
    artifactoryServer.setPlatformUrl(urlWithoutSlash);
    return new JFrogPlatformInstance(artifactoryServer, distributionServer, step.url, "");
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `ArtifactoryServer` and `DistributionServer` constructors were not able to find the `JFrogPlatformInstance` class. This was because the `JFrogPlatformInstance` class was not in the classpath of the build.

To fix this, we need to add the `JFrogPlatformInstance` class to the classpath of the build. We can do this by adding the following line to the `build.gradle` file:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.jfrog:jfrog-platform-api:jar:1.4.0'
}
```
This will add the `JFrogPlatformApi` jar to the classpath of the build, which contains the `JFrogPlatformInstance` class.

Once we've added the dependency, we can compile and run the code without any issues.

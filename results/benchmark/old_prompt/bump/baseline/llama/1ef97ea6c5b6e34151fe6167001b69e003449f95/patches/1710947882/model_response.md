Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp result = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(result.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a variable `result` of type `java.sql.Timestamp` to hold the result of `super.between(from, to)`, which is also of type `java.sql.Timestamp`. Then, it creates a new `Timestamp` object using the `getTime()` method of `result`, which returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).

This patch should fix the error because it converts the `java.util.Date` returned by `super.between(from, to)` to `java.sql.Timestamp` using the `getTime()` method, which returns a long value that can be used to construct a `Timestamp` object.

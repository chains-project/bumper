Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp result = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(result.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a variable `result` of type `java.sql.Timestamp` to hold the result of `super.between(from, to)`, which is also of type `java.sql.Timestamp`. Then, it returns a new `Timestamp` object constructed from the `result` object's `getTime()` method.

This patch avoids the type mismatch error by casting the `super.between(from, to)` result to `java.sql.Timestamp` before creating a new `Timestamp` object.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Date sqlDate = new java.sql.Date(between(from, to).getTime());
    return new Timestamp(sqlDate.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a new `java.sql.Date` object from the result of `super.between(from, to).getTime()`, which returns a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). The `java.sql.Date` constructor takes this long value and creates a `java.sql.Date` object representing the corresponding SQL date.

Finally, the patch creates a new `Timestamp` object from the `java.sql.Date` object using the `Timestamp(long timestamp)` constructor, which takes the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch as its argument.

This patch should fix the error by converting the `java.util.Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to).getTime()` to a `java.sql.Date` object, which can be used to create a `Timestamp` object.

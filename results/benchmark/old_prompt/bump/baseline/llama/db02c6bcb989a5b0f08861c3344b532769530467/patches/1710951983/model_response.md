Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(false, " pulling image " + image)
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the full message, and the second is a `boolean` that indicates whether the `String` should be treated as negated. In the original code, the second parameter is `false`, which means that the `String` should be treated as a positive match.

However, the error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because the `StringContains` class has been updated to require a third parameter, `negate`, which is a `boolean` that indicates whether the `String` should be treated as negated.

To fix the error, we can modify the `imagePulled` method to use the `AllOf` class, which allows us to chain multiple matchers together. We can create two `StringContains` matchers, one that looks for the message "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image, and another that looks for the message " pulling image " + image. We then pass these two matchers to the `AllOf` constructor to create a new matcher that matches both conditions.

This modified code should compile and run without errors.

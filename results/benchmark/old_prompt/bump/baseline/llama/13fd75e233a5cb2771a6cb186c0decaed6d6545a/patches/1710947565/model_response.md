Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringEndsWith(image)
    );
}
```
The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because `StringContains` expects a single string argument representing the entire input string, but the code passes two string arguments: `false` and the format string.

The proposed patch uses the `AllOf` matcher, which allows combining multiple matchers. It creates a new `StringContains` matcher that matches the format string and a new `StringEndsWith` matcher that matches the image name. The `AllOf` matcher ensures that both matchers must match for the input string to be considered a match.

This patch does not change the method signature, and it removes the `Override` decorator since it is not needed. The `StringContains` and `StringEndsWith` matchers are from the Hamcrest library, which is already included in the project's dependencies.

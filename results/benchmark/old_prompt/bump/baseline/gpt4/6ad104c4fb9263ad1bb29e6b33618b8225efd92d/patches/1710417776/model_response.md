Based on the error message, it seems that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist in the current classpath. This might be due to a missing or incorrect version of the BouncyCastle library. 

However, as a software engineer, I am only allowed to make changes to the client code. Therefore, I cannot directly fix the issue by adding or updating the library in the project's dependencies.

One possible solution would be to use a different package from the BouncyCastle library that provides similar functionality. If the `AlertDescription` class is not available in the newer version of the BouncyCastle library, we might need to use an alternative class. 

Since you did not provide the context or use case of the `AlertDescription` class, I will assume that you are using it to handle TLS alerts. In the newer version of BouncyCastle, the `AlertDescription` class is replaced by the `AlertLevel` class in the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package. 

Here is the modified code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertLevel;
```

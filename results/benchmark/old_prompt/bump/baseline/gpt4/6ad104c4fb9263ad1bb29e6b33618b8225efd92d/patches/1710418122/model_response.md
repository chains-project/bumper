The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the library not being properly imported or the library version being used does not contain this package. 

Since we can't change the external dependencies, we can try to replace the `TlsFatalAlert` with an equivalent class from a different package that exists in the current version of the library.

However, without knowing the exact version of the library being used and the available classes, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. 

Here is a general approach:

```java
  import org.bouncycastle.crypto.SomeOtherPackage.SomeEquivalentClass;
```

Replace `SomeOtherPackage` and `SomeEquivalentClass` with the actual package and class names in your version of the library. 

You might need to adjust the rest of your code to work with this new class.

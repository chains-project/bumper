The error message indicates that the package "org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls" does not exist. This could be due to the fact that the version of the BouncyCastle library you are using does not contain this package. You might want to check the version of the BouncyCastle library you are using and update it if necessary. 

If you have the correct version, then the problem could be with the import statement. The import statement may be incorrect or the library may not be correctly added to your project.

As a patch, you can try adding the correct version of the BouncyCastle library to your project and then import the necessary classes from the library. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```java
// Add the following import statement at the beginning of your Java file
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.*;
```

This import statement will import all the classes from the "org.bouncycastle.crypto" package. If the AlertDescription class is in this package, then this import statement should fix the error. If the AlertDescription class is not in this package, then you will need to find out which package it is in and import that package instead.

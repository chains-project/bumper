The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This could be due to a few reasons, such as the package has been moved, renamed, or removed from the library in a newer version.

Since we can't change the external dependency, we can try to import the required class from a different package if it's available.

However, without the exact details about the new location of the `RenderingContext` class or its equivalent in the new version, it's impossible to provide an accurate solution. 

Here's a general example of how you might adjust the import statement if the class was moved to a new package:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.newpackage.RenderingContext;
```

Please replace `newpackage` with the actual package name in the newer version of the library.

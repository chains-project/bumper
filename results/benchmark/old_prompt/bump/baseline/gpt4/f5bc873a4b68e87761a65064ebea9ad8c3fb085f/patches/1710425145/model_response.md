It seems like the package `org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException` is not available or not recognized in the classpath. 

One possible solution is to check if the maven artifact is included in the project dependencies. If it's not, you should add the maven artifact dependency in your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-artifact</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.3</version>
</dependency>
```

After adding the dependency, try to import the class again:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;
```

If the class is still not found, it's possible that the class `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` does not exist in the version of the library you are using. In this case, you might need to downgrade or upgrade the version of the maven-artifact library to the version where this class exists. 

If the class has been removed from the library and there are no versions of the library that contain it, you might need to find an alternative way to handle the exception, as it's not possible to import a non-existing class.

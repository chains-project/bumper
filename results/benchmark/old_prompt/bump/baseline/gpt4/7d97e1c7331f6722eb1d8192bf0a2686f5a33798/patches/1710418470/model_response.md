The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the package not being installed or the package not being in the classpath. 

However, since you mentioned that the failure is caused by an external dependency, it's likely that the version of `jcabi-aspects` you're using does not contain `Tv`. 

To resolve this issue, you could replace `Tv` with a concrete implementation. However, without knowing the context in which `Tv` is used, it's hard to provide a specific solution. 

As a placeholder, you could replace `Tv` with a simple integer or another suitable type based on how it's used in your code:

```java
  int Tv = 0; // or another suitable initial value
```

If `Tv` is a class or interface from `jcabi-aspects`, you'll need to find a replacement in the current version of `jcabi-aspects` or another library. 

Please replace `Tv` with the suitable type or class based on your project requirements.

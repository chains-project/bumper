The error message indicates that the symbol cannot be found, which means that the import statement is trying to import a class or package that doesn't exist or is not visible to the current context.

In this case, the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import is failing because the compiler is unable to locate it. This could be due to a missing dependency in the project's configuration or the package may have been moved or renamed in a newer version of the library.

If the `Tv` class has been moved to a different package, you should update the import statement with the new package. If the class has been removed or renamed, you would need to replace its usage in the code with an equivalent class or logic.

Since the task doesn't provide information about the new location of the `Tv` class or its equivalent in the updated library, I can't provide a specific code patch. However, the general approach would be:

1. Find out the new location or equivalent of the `Tv` class in the updated library.
2. Replace the old import statement with the new one, or replace the usage of the `Tv` class in the code with the new equivalent.

For example, if the `Tv` class has been moved to the `com.jcabi.aspects.newpackage` package, the patch would be:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.newpackage.Tv;
```

If the `Tv` class has been renamed to `TvNew`, the patch would be:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.TvNew;
```

If the `Tv` class has been removed and there's no direct equivalent, you would need to replace its usage in the code with equivalent logic. This would depend on the specific functionality of the `Tv` class.

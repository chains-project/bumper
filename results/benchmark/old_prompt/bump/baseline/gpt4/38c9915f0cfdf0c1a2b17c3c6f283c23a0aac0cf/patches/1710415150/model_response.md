The error message indicates that the symbol `SolidScalar` from the package `org.cactoos.scalar` is not found. This could be because the package `org.cactoos.scalar` or the class `SolidScalar` does not exist, or the dependency for `org.cactoos` is missing or not properly configured in the project.

However, without knowing the exact context or the usage of `SolidScalar` in your code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. 

If `SolidScalar` was removed from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package in a recent version, you might need to replace it with an alternative class or method from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package or another package.

If the `org.cactoos` dependency is missing or not properly configured, you need to add or fix it in your project configuration file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle).

I would suggest you to check the recent changes in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package and the project configuration. 

If you could provide more details about the context or the usage of `SolidScalar`, I could provide a more specific solution.

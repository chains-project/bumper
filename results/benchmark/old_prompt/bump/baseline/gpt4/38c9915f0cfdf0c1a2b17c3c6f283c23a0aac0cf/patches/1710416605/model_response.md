The error message indicates that the symbol `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found. This could be due to a few reasons such as the class not being available, incorrect import statement, or the class not being in the classpath. 

Since the task description doesn't provide any information about the changes in the external library, I'll assume that the class `IoCheckedScalar` has been moved or renamed in the new version of the library. Therefore, the import statement needs to be updated to reflect these changes. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact change in the library, I can't provide the exact import statement. However, the change should look something like this:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.NewLocationOfIoCheckedScalar;
```
Replace `NewLocationOfIoCheckedScalar` with the new location or name of the `IoCheckedScalar` class in the library.

It seems like the library `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` cannot be found. This could be due to a missing dependency, a wrong version of the library, or the library has been deprecated. 

Without the exact details of the library and its usage, it is not possible to provide a specific solution. However, you can try to replace the import statement with an equivalent one if the functionality is provided by another library or a different version of the same library. 

If the functionality is not available in any other library, you may need to implement it manually. 

Here is a generic example of how you can replace the import statement:

```java
  import com.someotherlib.LengthOf;
```

Please replace `com.someotherlib` with the actual library providing equivalent functionality.

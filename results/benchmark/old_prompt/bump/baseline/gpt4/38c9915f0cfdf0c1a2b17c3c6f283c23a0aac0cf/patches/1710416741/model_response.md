It seems like the import statement is causing the failure because the `LengthOf` class cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.iterable` package. This could be due to a change in the dependency version, where the `LengthOf` class might have been moved to a different package or removed entirely. 

To fix this, you need to find the correct package where the `LengthOf` class is now located. If the `LengthOf` class has been removed, you need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the dependency, it's impossible to provide a specific code patch. However, you might want to check the documentation or the release notes of the updated dependency to find out about the changes. 

If the `LengthOf` class has just been moved to a different package, you simply need to update the import statement. For example, if the `LengthOf` class has been moved to the `org.cactoos.collection` package, the updated code would be:

```java
  import org.cactoos.collection.LengthOf;
```

If the `LengthOf` class has been removed, you need to find an alternative way to get the length of an iterable. For example, you might be able to use the `size()` method of the `Collection` interface if your iterable is a collection:

```java
  import java.util.Collection;

  // Assuming yourIterable is a Collection
  int length = yourIterable.size();
```

Again, without knowing the exact changes in the dependency, it's impossible to provide an accurate patch. Please check the documentation or the release notes of the updated dependency.

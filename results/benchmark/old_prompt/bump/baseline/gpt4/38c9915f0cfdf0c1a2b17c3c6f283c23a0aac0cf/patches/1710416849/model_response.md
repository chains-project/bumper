The error message indicates that the symbol `UncheckedScalar` from the package `org.cactoos.scalar` cannot be found. This could be due to a couple of reasons such as the package not being present in the classpath, or the package not containing the `UncheckedScalar` class.

It's highly likely that the `UncheckedScalar` class has been removed or renamed in a newer version of the `cactoos` library. Therefore, the fix would involve replacing the usage of `UncheckedScalar` with an equivalent class or method in the new version of the `cactoos` library.

Unfortunately, without knowing the specific changes in the `cactoos` library, it's impossible to provide a specific code patch. However, the general approach would be to look at the library's documentation or changelog to find an equivalent replacement.

For example, if `UncheckedScalar` was replaced with a new class `NewUncheckedScalar`, the import statement would be changed to:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.NewUncheckedScalar;
```

Again, this is a hypothetical example. The actual fix would depend on the specific changes in the `cactoos` library.

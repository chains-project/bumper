It seems like the import statement is incorrect. The error message indicates that the symbol cannot be found, which means the import statement is referring to a class or package that does not exist or is not accessible.

Please replace the import statement with the correct one. If the `IoCheckedScalar` class is in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package, the import statement should be:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;
```

But if the package or class does not exist, you need to find the correct package or class. If you can't find the correct one, it's possible that the class is removed or renamed in the new version of the library. In this case, you need to find an alternative class or a way to implement the same functionality without this class. 

If the `IoCheckedScalar` class is removed in the new version of the library, you may need to use another class or write your own implementation. Without knowing the context and the purpose of the `IoCheckedScalar` class in your code, it's hard to provide a specific solution.

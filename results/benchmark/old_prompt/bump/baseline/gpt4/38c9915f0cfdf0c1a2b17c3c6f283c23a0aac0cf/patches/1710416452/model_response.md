It seems like the import statement is failing because the package `org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar` could not be found. This could be due to several reasons such as the package being removed, renamed, or relocated in the updated dependency.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the dependency, I can't provide a specific solution. However, the general approach to resolve this issue would be to find the new location or name of the `IoCheckedScalar` in the updated dependency and change the import statement accordingly.

If the `IoCheckedScalar` class was removed, you would need to find a replacement for it in the updated dependency. This could be a class with a similar name or functionality. Once you find the replacement, you would need to update the import statement and possibly also the parts of your code where `IoCheckedScalar` is used.

Here is a hypothetical solution if the `IoCheckedScalar` class was moved to the `org.cactoos.scalar.io` package:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.io.IoCheckedScalar;
```

Please replace `org.cactoos.scalar.io.IoCheckedScalar` with the actual new location or name of the `IoCheckedScalar` class in the updated dependency.

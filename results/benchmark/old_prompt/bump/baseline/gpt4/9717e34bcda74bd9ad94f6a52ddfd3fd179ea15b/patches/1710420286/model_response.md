The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This could be due to the `Tv` class being removed or relocated in a recent update of the `jcabi-aspects` library. 

Since we can't change the external dependency, we should try to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality provided by the `Tv` class within the client code. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the specific use of `Tv` in the code, it's hard to propose a specific patch. However, if `Tv` was used for its common use case of converting time values, you could substitute it with the `TimeUnit` class in Java's standard library.

Here is a sample patch:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
```

Please replace the `Tv` usage in your code with equivalent methods from `TimeUnit`.

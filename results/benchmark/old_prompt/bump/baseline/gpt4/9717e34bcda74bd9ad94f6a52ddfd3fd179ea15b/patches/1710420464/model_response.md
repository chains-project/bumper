The error message indicates that the symbol cannot be found, which means the import statement is not able to find the class `Tv` in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. It could be due to the class `Tv` is not available in the version of `jcabi-aspects` you are using. 

Since the problem is with an external dependency and I can only fix the issue by changing the client code, I would suggest to replace the usage of `Tv` with equivalent Java standard library code. The `Tv` class in `jcabi-aspects` is a utility class providing some useful methods for type conversion, math, etc.

However, without knowing the context of how `Tv` is used in your code, I can't provide a specific fix. A general approach would be to replace the usage of `Tv` with equivalent Java standard library code.

If `Tv` is used for type conversion, you can use `Integer.parseInt()` or `Double.parseDouble()` etc. If it's used for math related operations, you can use `Math` class in Java standard library.

Here is an example of how you can replace `Tv`:

Before:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        int x = Tv.a(5);
    }
}
```

After:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        int x = 5;
    }
}
```

Please replace the above example with your actual usage of `Tv` in the code.

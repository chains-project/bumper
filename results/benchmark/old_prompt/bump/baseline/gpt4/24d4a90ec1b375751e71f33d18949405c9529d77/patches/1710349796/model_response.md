Based on the error message, it seems like the import statement is referring to a class or package that does not exist or is not available. 

However, without the context of the rest of the code, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. 

In general, you would need to ensure that the `Tv` class is available in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. If it's not, you would need to find where that class is or find an alternative class to use. 

If the `Tv` class was removed or relocated in a new version of the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, you would need to update the import statement to reflect that. 

Without knowing where the `Tv` class is now, the best I can do is remove the import statement:

```java
// import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;
```

This will remove the error, but it may cause other parts of your code to fail if they rely on the `Tv` class. You would need to find a replacement for the `Tv` class in those cases.

The error message is indicating that the symbol `CertificationPermission` cannot be found. This is likely due to the fact that the library or package `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission` is either not installed or not imported correctly.

Since we can't change the dependencies, we can try to import the `CertificationPermission` from another package that is available in the current dependencies. If there's no other package that provides `CertificationPermission`, we can't fix the issue without changing the dependencies.

Assuming there's an alternative package `eu.europa.esig.dss.model.pades.CertificationPermission` that provides `CertificationPermission`, we can replace the failing import with the following one:

```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.model.pades.CertificationPermission;
```

Please replace the failing import with the above one and recompile the code. If the issue persists, it means there's no alternative package that provides `CertificationPermission` and we can't fix the issue without changing the dependencies.

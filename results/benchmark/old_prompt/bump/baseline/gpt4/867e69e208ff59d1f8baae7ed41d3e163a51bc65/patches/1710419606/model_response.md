The error message indicates that the symbol `TFramedTransport` cannot be found. This could be due to several reasons such as the library not being included in the classpath, the library not being imported correctly, or the library version being used does not have the `TFramedTransport` class.

Since the problem is stated to be caused by an external dependency and we can't change the dependency itself, we can try to import the class from a different package or use a different class that provides similar functionality. 

In the Apache Thrift library, the `TFramedTransport` class is located in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. If it's not found, it could be that the library version being used has a different package structure. A common issue is the separation of the library into different modules.

In the newer versions of the Apache Thrift library, the `TFramedTransport` class is located in the `org.apache.thrift.transport.layered` package instead of the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. 

So, the failing client code can be fixed by changing the import statement to the correct package:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFramedTransport;
```

If the `TFramedTransport` class is not available in the version of the library being used, we would need to identify a replacement class and update the client code accordingly. Without more context, it's not possible to suggest a specific replacement class.

It seems like the library `org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport` is not found. This could be due to various reasons such as the library not being installed or the wrong version of the library being used. 

If the library is not installed, you need to add it to your project dependencies. If you are using Maven, you can add the following lines to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>
    <artifactId>libthrift</artifactId>
    <version>0.12.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If the library is installed but the wrong version is being used, you need to update the version number in your project dependencies to match the one that contains `TFramedTransport`.

If the library is installed and the correct version is being used, it could be that `TFramedTransport` has been moved to a different package or has been renamed. In this case, you need to find the new package or name and update your import statement accordingly.

Since I cannot make changes to the project dependencies and I don't know the new package or name if `TFramedTransport` has been moved or renamed, I cannot provide a code patch to fix the error.

Here's a possible patch to fix the failing method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<? extends ManagedObject>> reg = (SortedMap) registry.get(server);
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The patch casts the `registry` value to a raw type of `SortedMap` before putting the new `ManagedObject` into it. This way, the warning about incompatible types is resolved.

Note that using raw types is generally discouraged, but in this case, it is a simple way to fix the issue without changing the external library. It is recommended to find a more robust solution in the long term, such as fixing the external dependency or reporting the issue to the library maintainers.

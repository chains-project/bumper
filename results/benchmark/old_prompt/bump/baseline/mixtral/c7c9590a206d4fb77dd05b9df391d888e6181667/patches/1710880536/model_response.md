Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        ReportGenerator generator = new ReportGenerator(); // added
        generator.generate( sink, locale ); // changed
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

The error message suggests that the symbol `generate` cannot be found. To fix this, I created a new `ReportGenerator` class and added a `generate` method to it. Then, I replaced the call to `generate` with a call to `generator.generate`.

Note that the `ReportGenerator` class and `generate` method are not part of the original code, so you will need to add them to your project. Also, the implementation of the `generate` method will depend on the requirements of your project.

Here's a patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        ReportGenerator reportGenerator = new ReportGenerator(); // added
        reportGenerator.generate( sink, locale ); // modified
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

The patch adds a new `ReportGenerator` instance and modifies the `generate` method call to use this new instance. This assumes that the `ReportGenerator` class has been added to the project and contains the necessary method signatures. If the `generate` method is still not found, you may need to check the version of the library being used and update it if a new version with the required method is available.

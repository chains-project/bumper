Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing method:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        File outputFile = new File(outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html");
        generate( sink, locale, outputFile );
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException | IOException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

The changes made include:

* Adding a `File` variable `outputFile` to store the output file path.
* Modifying the `generate` method call to include the new `outputFile` variable and update the method signature to include `IOException`.
* Updating the `try-catch` block to handle both `MavenReportException` and `IOException`.

Note: The actual cause of the error message cannot be determined without more context about the libraries being used. However, the above changes provide a general solution that should work for most cases of "cannot find symbol" errors related to external dependencies. If the error persists, additional debugging and error messages will be required to identify the root cause.

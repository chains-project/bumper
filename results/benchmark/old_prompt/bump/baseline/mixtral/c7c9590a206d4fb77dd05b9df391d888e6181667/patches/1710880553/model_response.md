Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        generate( sink, locale, getLog() ); // pass the log object
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}

// Add a new generate method overload that accepts a logger
private void generate(SiteRendererSink sink, Locale locale, Logger logger)
throws MavenReportException
{
    // Implement the report generation logic here, using the logger object for logging
}
```

The patch adds a new overload of the `generate` method that accepts a `Logger` object. This new method is then called from the `execute` method, passing the `getLog()` object as an argument.

The `generate` method can then use the `logger` object to log any messages or errors that occur during report generation.

Note that the `generate` method signature was not changed, but a new method was added. Also, the `--` and `++` notation was not used, as per the instructions.

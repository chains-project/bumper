Based on the error message, it seems that the `StringContains` constructor is not accepting the provided argument. The constructor `StringContains(boolean, String)` is not found in the `org.hamcrest.core.StringContains` class.

If we look at the error message, it seems that the first argument should be a `String` and not a `boolean`. So, we can assume that the coder intended to use the `is()` method from `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` to convert the `boolean` to a `Matcher<String>`.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return is(containsString(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image))));
}

private static Matcher<String> containsString(final String str) {
    return new StringContains(str);
}
```
Explanation:

* We create a new helper method `containsString` to create the `StringContains` object, so that we can use the `is()` method from `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` to convert the `boolean` to a `Matcher<String>`.
* We use the `is()` method to convert the `Matcher<String>` returned by `containsString` to a `Matcher<String>`.

Note:

* I added the `is()` method based on the assumption that the coder intended to use it. If this assumption is incorrect, then the coder needs to review the code and determine the correct `Matcher<String>` to use.
* The `StringContains` constructor takes a `String` as its second argument, so we use `containsString` to format the string, rather than using `String.format` directly.
* The `is()` method is added in `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` and is available in the version used in the code.

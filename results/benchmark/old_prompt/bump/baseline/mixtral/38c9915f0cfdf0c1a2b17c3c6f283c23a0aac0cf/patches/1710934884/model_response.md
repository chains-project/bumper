I see that the error message is pointing to line 41, column 1 of the file `WalletsIn.java`. It seems that the problem is not directly related to the import statement but rather to the class that is being declared in the file.

Without seeing the full code of the `WalletsIn` class, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. However, I can suggest a general approach to fixing the issue.

It's possible that the `JoinedText` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package has been removed or renamed in the newer version of the library that you are using. To fix the issue, you can try using a different class from the library that provides similar functionality.

For example, you can try using the `TextJoined` class from the `com.squareup.okhttp3.internal.io` package instead. This class provides similar functionality to the `JoinedText` class.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `WalletsIn` class to use the `TextJoined` class instead:
```java
import com.squareup.okhttp3.internal.io.TextJoined; // import the TextJoined class

// ...

@Override
public String asString() throws IOException {
    TextJoined joined = new TextJoined(", ", accounts().stream().map(Account::asString));
    return String.format("{\"addresses\":%s}", joined.value());
}
```
Note that the `TextJoined` class expects a list of `CharSequence` objects as input, so we need to map the `accounts()` stream to a stream of `String` objects using the `Account::asString` method.

Also note that the `TextJoined` class returns a `Text` object, which we then convert to a `String` using the `value()` method.

This is just an example of how you can modify the `WalletsIn` class to fix the issue. Depending on the specifics of your use case, you may need to modify the code differently.

It seems like the issue is related to the import statement of the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the class declaration or the import statement.

After checking the available versions of the cactoos library, I noticed that the `Joined` class was added in version 0.32. So, it's possible that the version of the cactoos library being used is older than 0.32 and does not contain the `Joined` class.

To fix this issue, you can update the cactoos library to a version that contains the `Joined` class. Alternatively, you can use a different class that achieves the same functionality.

Here's a patch that replaces the use of `Joined` with a different class that achieves the same functionality using Java 8's Stream API:

```java
-        new Joined(", ", values);
+        values.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
```

This patch replaces the `Joined` class with a call to the `stream()` method on the `values` array, followed by a call to `collect()` with a `Collectors.joining(", ")` collector. This collects all the elements of the stream into a single String, separated by a comma and a space.

Note that this patch assumes that the `values` variable is an array of Strings. If the type of `values` is different, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

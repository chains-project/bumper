I see that the error message is indicating that there is a problem with the import statement for the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the version of the library not being compatible with the code, or the library not being properly installed.

To fix this error, you can try updating the library to the latest version, or using a specific version that is known to be compatible with the code. If that doesn't work, you can try using a different library that provides similar functionality.

Here is an example of how you can modify the code to use a different library that provides similar functionality:
```
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

// ...

public String asString(Iterable<String> values) throws IOException {
    return String.join("", values.stream().collect(Collectors.joining("")));
}
```
This code uses the `stream` and `collect` methods from the `java.util.stream` package to join the elements of the `Iterable` into a single `String`. This should have the same effect as the original code that used the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package.

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the code further to fit the specific requirements of your application.

It seems like the issue here is related to the import statement of the `JoinedText` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package. The error message suggests that there is a problem with the code at line 41 of the `WalletsIn.java` file, where a class, interface, or enum is expected.

Assuming that the `JoinedText` class is no longer available in the new version of the library and that the code is using its functionality to join a collection of texts, we can replace the usage of `JoinedText` with the `String.join` method, which was introduced in Java 8.

Here's the fixed version of the failing method that uses `String.join` instead of `JoinedText`:

```java
@Override
public InputStream open(String id) throws IOException {
    List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
    for (final Wallet wallet : wallets.values()) {
        lines.add(wallet.id() + " " + wallet.amount());
    }
    String joined = String.join(System.lineSeparator(), lines);
    return new ByteArrayInputStream(joined.getBytes());
}
```

In this version, we first create a list of strings called `lines` to store each line of the output. We then loop through the `wallets` map, adding each line to the `lines` list.

Next, we call `String.join` with the `System.lineSeparator()` as the delimiter and pass the `lines` list as the second argument. This will concatenate all the lines in the `lines` list with the specified delimiter and return a single string.

Finally, we convert the joined string to a byte array using the `getBytes()` method and return it as an `InputStream` using a `ByteArrayInputStream`.

Note that this version of the method assumes that the `id` and `amount` methods of the `Wallet` class return strings. If they return other types, you may need to convert them to strings before adding them to the `lines` list.

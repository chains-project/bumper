It seems like the issue is related to the import statement, and the class `Joined` from the `org.cactoos.text` package is causing the failure. I will try to fix the error without using the `Joined` class.

Here's the fixed version of the failing method using `StringJoiner` from the Java standard library (available since Java 8) instead of `Joined`:

```java
import java.util.StringJoiner;

@Override
public String asJson() throws IOException {
    StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(",", "[", "]");
    for (Wallet wallet : this.wallets) {
        joiner.add(new GsonBuilder().create().toJson(wallet));
    }
    return joiner.toString();
}
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement and the usage of `Joined` with `StringJoiner`, which allows joining strings with a delimiter. This should resolve the error and make the code work again.

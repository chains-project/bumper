Here is a patch for the failing method using only added library methods (denoted with '++'):

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    ResourcePatternResolver resolver = new PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver();
    Resourse[] resources = resolver.getResources("classpath*:" + testSrcFolder.getPath() + "/**/*.class");
    List<String> classLocations = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Resourse resource : resources) {
        try {
            classLocations.add(resource.getURI().toString());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // handle exception
        }
    }
    return classLocations;
}
```

This solution uses the Spring Framework's `ResourcePatternResolver` and `Resource` classes to find the class files within the given `testSrcFolder`. It returns a list of the class file locations as strings.

Note: You may need to import the necessary classes and handle the exception appropriately in your production code.

Here's a patch to fix the failing client code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    String imagePattern = String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
    return new TypeSafeMatcher<String>() {
        @Override
        public boolean matchesSafely(String item) {
            return item.contains(imagePattern);
        }

        @Override
        public void describeTo(Description description) {
            description.appendText("a string containing ").appendValue(image);
        }
    }.describedAs("imagePulled(" + image + ")");
}
```

The issue in the original code is that the `imagePattern` string was being constructed inside the `matchesSafely` method, which was causing a compilation error because the `image` variable is not effectively final. To fix this, I've moved the creation of `imagePattern` outside of the `TypeSafeMatcher` anonymous class, making it a final variable that can be used inside the class.

Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    Description description = Description.createChainedWithConverter((Description.ChainedConverter) null);
    return new TypeSafeMatcher<String>() {
        @Override
        protected boolean matchesSafely(String item) {
            return item.contains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
        }

        @Override
        public void describeTo(Description description) {
            description.appendText("a string containing ").appendValue(image);
        }
    }.describeTo(description);
}
```

The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at column 78 of the line containing the `describeTo` method call. This suggests that the method call is being interpreted as a statement on its own, rather than as a method call within the `imagePulled` method. To fix this, I created a local variable `description` of type `Description`, and passed it as an argument to the `describeTo` method. This ensures that the `describeTo` method call is correctly interpreted as a method call with an argument, rather than as a standalone statement.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` decorator from the `describeTo` method, because it is still overriding the `describeTo` method in the `Matcher` interface. Additionally, I did not use any removed library methods, and did not change the function signature.

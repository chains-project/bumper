Here's a possible patch to fix the failing method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) registry.get(server);
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The only change made is to explicitly cast the `registry.get(server)` to `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>` before assigning it to the `reg` variable. This is necessary because the return type of `registry.get(server)` is `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>`, which is not compatible with `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`. The explicit cast informs the compiler that we are aware of the potential type mismatch and that we are taking responsibility for any potential `ClassCastException` that may occur at runtime.

Note that this solution assumes that the actual objects in the map are indeed of type `ManagedObject`. If this is not the case, then a `ClassCastException` will be thrown at runtime. In that case, a more robust solution would be needed, such as changing the type of the `reg` variable to `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>` and modifying the rest of the method accordingly.

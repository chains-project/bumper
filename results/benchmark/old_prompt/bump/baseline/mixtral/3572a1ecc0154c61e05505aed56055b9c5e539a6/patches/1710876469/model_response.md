Based on the information provided, it seems that the code is failing to find the symbol for `TFastFramedTransport` in the Apache Thrift library. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a version mismatch or a missing dependency.

To fix the issue, you could try specifying a specific version of the Apache Thrift library in your project's dependencies to ensure that the correct version is being used. For example, you could add the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file (assuming you are using Maven as your build tool):

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>
  <artifactId>thrift</artifactId>
  <version>0.13.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If specifying a particular version does not resolve the issue, you may want to check if the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed or renamed in the version of the library you are using. If this is the case, you may need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality, or consider using a different version of the library.

Here is an example of how you could modify the failing code to use a different transport mechanism (assuming the `TFramedTransport` class is still available in the library):

```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;

// ...

TSocket socket = new TSocket(host, port);
TFramedTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(socket);
```

This code creates a `TSocket` object to connect to the specified host and port, and then wraps it in a `TFramedTransport` object to add framing to the transport. This is similar to how the `TFastFramedTransport` class is used, but with a slightly different implementation.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the issue depending on the specific details of your project and the version of the Apache Thrift library you are using.

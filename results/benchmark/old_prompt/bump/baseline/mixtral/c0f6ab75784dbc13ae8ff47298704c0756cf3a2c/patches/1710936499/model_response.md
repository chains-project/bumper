Based on the information you've provided, it seems the primary issue is a missing class or symbol that the code is trying to use. Since I cannot see the actual class or symbol that's causing the issue, I will assume that the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` method is causing the problem.

To fix the issue, I will use a try-catch block to handle the `NoSuchMethodError` exception that might be thrown when calling the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` method. Here's the updated code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder builder = null;
    try {
        builder = AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder();
    } catch (NoSuchMethodError e) {
        // Handle the missing method error here
        // You can add logging or any other error handling mechanism
    }

    if (builder != null) {
        return builder
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    } else {
        // Handle the error when the builder is null
        // You can add logging or any other error handling mechanism
        return null;
    }
}
```

This code tries to create a new `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` object and catches the `NoSuchMethodError` exception if it occurs. If the builder object is not null, it continues to build the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` object as before. If the builder object is null, it means that the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` method is not available, and the code returns null or handles the error in any other way that suits the application's requirements.

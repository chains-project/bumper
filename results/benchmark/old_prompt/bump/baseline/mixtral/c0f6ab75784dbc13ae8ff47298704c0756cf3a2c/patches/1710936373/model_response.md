Here's a patch to fix the error in the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    PropertyNestedMap extraProperties = globalConfig.extraProperties();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(extraProperties != null ? extraProperties : Collections.emptyMap())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

The change here is to wrap the result of `globalConfig.extraProperties()` in a ternary statement that checks if it's not null. If it is null, it uses an empty map instead. This is to ensure that the `setExtraProperties` method is being passed a non-null value, as required by the library.

The `--` and `++` notations are not used in the patch, as this change does not rely on any removed or added library methods.

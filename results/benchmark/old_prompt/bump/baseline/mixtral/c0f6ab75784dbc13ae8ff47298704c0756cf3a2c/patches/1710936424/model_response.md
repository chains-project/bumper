Based on the information you've provided, it seems the error is caused by a missing class or symbol, specifically `AnalysisEngineConfiguration`. To fix this issue, I'll assume that there's a new version of the library that has either changed or removed this class. Instead, let's use `BaseAnalysisEngineConfiguration` which is a new class that provides similar functionality.

Here's the patched method:

```java
private static BaseAnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return BaseAnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

This code segment replaces the entire failing method by changing the class from `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` to `BaseAnalysisEngineConfiguration`. This should resolve the error message you provided. However, depending on the specific library changes, you might need to adjust the code further.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems the primary issue is a missing class or symbol that the code is trying to use. However, without knowing the full details of the external dependency or the specific version changes, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.

That being said, here's a proposed patch that might help fix the issue. This patch involves catching the `NoSuchMethodError` exception that might be thrown when the required method is not found in the external dependency. If that's the case, we can provide a default implementation for the missing method.

Here's the updated code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    try {
        // Assuming the missing symbol is a method in the AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder class
        Method setExtraPropertiesMethod = AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder.class.getMethod("setExtraProperties", Map.class);

        return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties()) // If the method is missing, this line will throw a NoSuchMethodError
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
        // If the method is missing, provide a default implementation
        return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    }
}
```
Note that this is just a workaround, and it might not work if the missing method is essential for the proper functioning of the code. In that case, you might need to update the external dependency to a version that includes the missing method.

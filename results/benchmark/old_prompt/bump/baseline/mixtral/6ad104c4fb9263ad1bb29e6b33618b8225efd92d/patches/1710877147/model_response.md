Based on the information provided, it seems the issue is caused by an incompatibility with the Bouncy Castle library. The error message suggests there is a syntax error in the ChachaDecoder.java file at line 23, specifically expecting a ';'.

In order to fix the issue, we need to examine the faulty code segment. However, you didn't provide the code. Thus, I will create a hypothetical scenario based on the information available.

Let's assume the ChachaDecoder.java file has the following faulty method:

```java
@Override
protected void finalize() throws IOException {
    JceTls.setChaChaEnabled(false); // faulty line
}
```

The issue here is the use of `JceTls`, which is no longer required in the new version. Instead, we can directly use the `Security` class from the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) to disable the ChaCha cipher.

Here's the fixed version of the method:

```java
@Override
protected void finalize() throws IOException {
    Security.removeProvider("BC");
}
```

This code removes the Bouncy Castle (BC) provider from the JCA, effectively disabling the ChaCha cipher.

Please note that this solution is hypothetical and might not apply directly to your actual code. However, this should give you an idea of how to resolve issues caused by dependency updates. In practice, you would need to identify the actual faulty code segment and adjust it accordingly.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems the error message is indicating a syntax error in the specified Java file. The error message states that a semicolon is expected, which usually indicates that a statement is missing a semicolon at the end.

Looking at the line of code you've provided, it appears to be a simple import statement, which should not cause a syntax error like this. However, without seeing the full codebase and the exact location of the error, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.

That being said, I can suggest a patch that might help fix the issue. One possibility is that there is a missing semicolon on the previous line of code. Here's a patch that adds a semicolon to the end of the previous line:

```java
if (cipherSuite.getJceId() == JceTls.CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256) {
    cipherSuite = new Chacha20Poly1305Suite(); // added semicolon here
}
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;
```

Of course, this is just a guess based on the information provided. If the error is still occurring after applying this patch, it would be helpful to have more information about the surrounding code and the exact location of the error.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems the issue is a compilation error related to a missing semicolon. I'll assume that the error is located in the problematic line and not in any external code that this file might be importing. Here's the fixed code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;

...

private void decode(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException, TLSFatalAlert {
    // Assuming the problem is in this line
    Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, UTF_8);
    ...
}
```

The provided error message suggests that there is a missing semicolon in the line with the `InputStreamReader` constructor call. I added the missing semicolon, so the code should now compile without issues. However, if the problem is elsewhere in the code, this patch might not solve the issue. In that case, additional context and information would be required.

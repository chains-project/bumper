I understand that you're asking for help in fixing the failing test in `CachingProxyITCase.java` class. The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor is causing an issue. I will propose a patch for the `imagePulled` method, assuming that the Hamcrest library has been updated and the new version does not have the `StringContains` constructor that accepts a `boolean` and two `String` arguments.

Here's the updated `imagePulled` method that uses the `is` method from the `TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher` class (assuming it is available in the Hamcrest version you are using) to create a matcher for the expected log message:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return is(allOf(
        stringContains("Status: Downloaded newer image for"),
        stringContainsIgnoringCase(image)
    ));
}
```

This updated method creates a matcher that checks if the log message contains the substring "Status: Downloaded newer image for" and ignores case sensitivity when checking if the log message contains the provided `image` value.

The `allOf` method from the Hamcrest library is used to combine the two matchers, ensuring that both conditions must be met.

This solution assumes that the updated Hamcrest version includes the `stringContains` and `stringContainsIgnoringCase` methods from the `TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher` class. If these methods are not available, you may need to find alternative ways to create the required matchers.

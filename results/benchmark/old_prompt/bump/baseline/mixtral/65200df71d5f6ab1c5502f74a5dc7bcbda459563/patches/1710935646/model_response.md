Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` method might be causing the issue. To fix this, we can try using a try-catch block to handle the exception and provide a default configuration in case of failure. Here's the updated code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    AnalysisEngineConfiguration config = null;
    try {
        config = AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exception and provide default configuration
        config = AnalysisEngineConfiguration.defaultConfiguration();
    }
    return config;
}
```
This code attempts to build the configuration as before, but if an exception is thrown, it catches it and provides a default configuration instead. This should prevent the code from failing and allow it to continue running.

Note that this is just a workaround, and the root cause of the issue should be investigated and addressed separately. Additionally, it's important to thoroughly test this code to ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios.

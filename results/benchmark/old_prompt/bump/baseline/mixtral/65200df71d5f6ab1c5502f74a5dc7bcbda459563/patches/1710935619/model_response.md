Based on the information you've provided, it seems the primary issue here is a missing class or symbol that the code is trying to reference. However, without knowing the full details of the libraries and versions being used, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.

That being said, here's a potential patch for the failing method that you can try:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```
In this patch, I've replaced the static import of `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` with an explicit instantiation of the `Builder` class. This should help ensure that the correct version of the class is being used, and avoid any issues with missing symbols or dependencies.

Of course, without more information about the specific libraries and versions being used, it's difficult to say for sure whether this will solve the issue. But hopefully this gives you a starting point for troubleshooting the problem.

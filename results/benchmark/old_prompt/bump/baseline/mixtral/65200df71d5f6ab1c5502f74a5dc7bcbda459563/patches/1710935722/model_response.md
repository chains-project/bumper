Based on the error message, it seems that the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` method is causing the issue. I will assume that the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` class is from an external library and we cannot change it. Therefore, we need to find a way to create an `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` object without causing any errors.

After checking the error message, I noticed that the error is caused by a missing symbol in the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` class. Specifically, the error message indicates that the `setModulesProvider` method is causing the issue.

To solve this issue, we can create a new `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` object and set all the necessary properties except for `setModulesProvider`. Instead of setting `setModulesProvider`, we can create a new `ModulesProvider` object and use it when building the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` object. Here's how we can modify the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method to fix the issue:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    ModulesProvider modulesProvider = globalConfig.getModulesProvider();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .build(modulesProvider);
}
```
In this modified version of the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method, we first create a new `ModulesProvider` object by calling `globalConfig.getModulesProvider()`. We then create a new `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` object and set all the necessary properties except for `setModulesProvider`.

Instead of setting `setModulesProvider`, we pass the `modulesProvider` object as an argument to the `build` method when building the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` object. This way, we avoid calling the `setModulesProvider` method, which is causing the issue.

Note that we have not changed the function signature, and we have created a new variable `modulesProvider` to make the code easier to understand. We have also removed the `@Override` decorator since the method is not overriding any method in the new version. We have not used any removed library methods, but we have used the new `build` method identified with `++`. Finally, we have only returned the fixed failing method, not the complete class code.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems the code is failing to find the symbol `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` which suggests that the external dependency causing the problem may be missing or outdated. However, since you've mentioned that we can only work on the client code, here's a modified version of the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method that might fix the issue:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    if (AnalysisEngineConfiguration.getClass() == null) {
        // If AnalysisEngineConfiguration is not found, return a default configuration object
        return new AnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
            @Override
            public SettableModuleDiscoverer modulesProvider() {
                return new DefaultModuleDiscoverer(Collections.emptyList());
            }

            @Override
            public File workDir() {
                return new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
            }

            @Override
            public Properties extraProperties() {
                return new Properties();
            }

            @Override
            public List<String> getEnabledLanguages() {
                return Collections.emptyList();
            }

            @Override
            public String clientPid() {
                return "0";
            }
        };
    }

    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```
This modified version checks if the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` class is available at runtime. If it's not found, it returns a default implementation of the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` interface. This way, even if the external dependency is missing or outdated, the code should still compile and run without issues.

However, it's important to note that this might not be the best solution for your use case, as it might not provide the expected functionality if `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` is not available. It's recommended to investigate the root cause of the missing symbol and update the external dependency accordingly.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems the primary issue is a missing class or symbol that the code is trying to use. However, without more information about the specific class or symbol that's causing the error, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.

That being said, here's a general approach you can take to fix the issue:

1. Identify the missing symbol: In this case, the error message indicates that the symbol `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` cannot be found. This suggests that the class or library that contains this symbol is either missing or not included in the project's classpath.
2. Check the project's dependencies: Make sure that the required library or class is included in the project's dependencies. If not, you can add it using your build tool (e.g. Maven, Gradle, etc.).
3. Check the classpath: Make sure that the library or class is included in the project's classpath. If not, you can add it using your build tool or IDE.
4. Check for compatibility issues: If the library or class is included in the project's dependencies and classpath, it's possible that there is a compatibility issue between the library or class and the project's version. In this case, you may need to upgrade or downgrade the library or class to a compatible version.

Based on these steps, here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    if (AnalysisEngineConfiguration == null) {
        // Add a try-catch block to handle the missing symbol error
        try {
            return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                    .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                    .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                    .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                    .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                    .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                    .build();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Log the error or handle it appropriately
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```
This patch adds a try-catch block around the failing code to handle the missing symbol error. This can help prevent the application from crashing and provide more information about the error. However, it's important to note that this is just a temporary fix and that the underlying issue should be addressed as soon as possible.

Note: This patch assumes that the missing symbol is a class or interface named `AnalysisEngineConfiguration`. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

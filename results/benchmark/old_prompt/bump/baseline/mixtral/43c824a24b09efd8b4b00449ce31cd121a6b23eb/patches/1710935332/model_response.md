Here's a patch for the given code that replaces the failing method with a version using Java Streams to simplify the code:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    return cache.get(branch.getJsonPath())
            .stream()
            .map(XmlFieldInstance::getValue)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```
This version uses Java 8's Stream API to map the `getValue` method on each `XmlFieldInstance` in the list returned by `cache.get`, and then collects the results into a new `List`.

Note: This assumes that the `getValue` method of `XmlFieldInstance` returns a `String`. If it doesn't, you may need to modify the `map` step accordingly.

Here is a patch for the failing method. It seems like the `XmlFieldInstance` class is not available anymore, so I replaced it with a `JsonFieldInstance` class, which I assume is a replacement for the previous class. I also added some null-checks to make the code safer.
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<JsonFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    if (instances == null) {
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    for (JsonFieldInstance instance : instances) {
        String value = instance.getValue();
        if (value != null) {
            values.add(value);
        }
    }
    return values;
}
```
Note that I made the following changes:

* Replaced `XmlFieldInstance` with `JsonFieldInstance`
* Added a null-check for `instances`
* Added a null-check for `value` before adding it to the `values` list

These changes should fix the compilation error and make the code safer and more robust.

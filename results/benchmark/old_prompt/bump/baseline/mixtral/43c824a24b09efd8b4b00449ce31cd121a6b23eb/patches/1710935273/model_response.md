Here is a proposed patch to fix the failing `extractList` method:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = (List<Object>) cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
        for (Object instance : instances)
            if (instance instanceof Map) {
                Map<String, Object> mapInstance = (Map<String, Object>) instance;
                values.add((String) mapInstance.getOrDefault("value", ""));
            }
    return values;
}
```
The changes made:

* The type of `instances` is changed from `List<XmlFieldInstance>` to `List<Object>` to avoid the compilation error.
* The for-loop is updated to handle the case where `instance` is not an `XmlFieldInstance` object.
* The value is extracted from the `mapInstance` using `getOrDefault("value", "")` to avoid NullPointerException in case the "value" key is missing in the map.

Note: This patch assumes that the json path returns a list of maps, where each map has a "value" key, or an empty string if the key is missing. If this assumption is incorrect, the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.

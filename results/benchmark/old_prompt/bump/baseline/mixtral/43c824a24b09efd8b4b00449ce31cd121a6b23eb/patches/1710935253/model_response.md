Here is a patch for the failing method. It seems like the error is caused by the use of `JsonPathCache` and `XmlFieldInstance` classes, which are not part of the provided code. So I will assume that these classes are part of the external dependencies that are causing the issue.

To resolve the issue, I am going to use the `JsonPath` class from the `com.jayway.jsonpath` library to extract the list of strings from the JSON data. This library is identified with `++` which means it is an added library method.
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (cache != null && branch != null) {
        String json = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
        if (json != null) {
            List<String> jsonValues = JsonPath.read(json, branch.getJsonPath());
            if (jsonValues != null) {
                values.addAll(jsonValues);
            }
        }
    }
    return values;
}
```
In this updated method, I am first checking if `cache` and `branch` are not `null`. If they are not `null`, I am getting the JSON data from the cache using the `get` method. If the JSON data is not `null`, I am using the `JsonPath.read` method to extract the list of strings from the JSON data using the JSON path from the `branch` object. Finally, I am adding the extracted values to the `values` list.

Note that I am assuming that the `JsonPathCache` class has a `get` method that returns a `String` representing the JSON data at the specified path. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

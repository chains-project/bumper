Here is a fixed version of the `extractList` method that should resolve the compilation error:

```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<JsonFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
        for (JsonFieldInstance instance : instances)
            values.add(instance.getValue().toString());
    return values;
}
```

The changes made include:

* Replacing `XmlFieldInstance` with `JsonFieldInstance` since `JsonFieldInstance` is more likely to be the correct type for the instances returned from the cache.
* Adding a call to `toString()` when adding the value to the list, since the `getValue()` method likely returns a non-String object.

These changes should allow the method to compile and run correctly. However, it's possible that further changes may be needed to make the method work correctly with the updated dependencies.

Here is a patch for the failing `extractList` method:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<XmlFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null) {
        for (XmlFieldInstance instance : instances) {
            Object value = instance.getValue();
            if (value != null) {
                values.add(value.toString());
            }
        }
    }
    return values;
}
```
The change made here is to ensure that the value extracted from the `XmlFieldInstance` is not null before calling the `toString()` method on it. This is because the error message suggests that the `getValue()` method may be returning a null value, which would cause a `NullPointerException` when calling `toString()`.

It's worth noting that the `++` and `--` symbols are not used here to indicate changes made to the code, as this was not requested. Only the fixed method is returned, as requested.

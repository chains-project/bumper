It seems like the external library `org.jasypt.spring.security` doesn't exist or is not available in your project's classpath. 

As a senior software engineer, I can't directly resolve this issue because it's related to the project's dependencies, not the code itself. However, you can try to resolve this issue by adding the correct dependency to your build file.

If you are using Maven, add the following dependency in your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
    <artifactId>jasypt-spring-security3</artifactId>
    <version>1.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the following dependency in your build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'org.jasypt:jasypt-spring-security3:1.9.3'
}
```

After adding the dependency, try to build your project again. If the error persists, check if the version of the library you are using is compatible with your project.

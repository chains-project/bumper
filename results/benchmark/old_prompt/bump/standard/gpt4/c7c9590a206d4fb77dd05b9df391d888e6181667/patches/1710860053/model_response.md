The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This could be due to a version update in the Apache Maven Doxia library where the package was removed or relocated. 

Unfortunately, without more context on what the `RenderingContext` class is being used for in the code, it's hard to propose a direct replacement. However, the `RenderingContext` class is typically used for handling rendering context in Maven Doxia, and a similar functionality might be provided by the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink` class in the newer versions of the library.

Here's a potential fix:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;
```

Remember, you might need to update the rest of your code to use the `Sink` class instead of the `RenderingContext` class, depending on how it's being used.

The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This could be due to a missing or outdated dependency. However, as a senior software engineer, I can only work on the client code to fix this error.

Since the `RenderingContext` class is not found in the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package, we should look for it in other packages of the `org.apache.maven.doxia` library.

After some research, I found that the `RenderingContext` class is actually located in the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink` package. 

Here is the corrected import statement:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.RenderingContext;
```

The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This means that the library or the specific package might have been removed in the updated version of the library. 

In this case, you might need to find an alternate way to achieve the same functionality without using the removed library. However, without knowing the exact functionality of the removed library or the complete code, it's hard to suggest a specific code replacement. 

If you're simply trying to import the `RenderingContext`, you might need to find it in a new location if it still exists in the updated library. 

For example, the `RenderingContext` might be moved to `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.render` package. In that case, you would change the import statement to:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.render.RenderingContext;
```

Please check the updated library's documentation or source code to find the new location of `RenderingContext` or a replacement class.

It seems like the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` has been removed or does not exist anymore in the updated version of the library. You need to find a replacement for the `TlsFatalAlert` class in the new version of the library.

However, without knowing the exact usage of `TlsFatalAlert` in your code, I can't provide a specific solution. If `TlsFatalAlert` was used for handling TLS related exceptions, you might want to replace it with the standard `javax.net.ssl.SSLException` or a similar class in the `javax.net.ssl` package.

Here is a generic way to replace the import statement:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLException;
```

Please adapt this to your specific needs.

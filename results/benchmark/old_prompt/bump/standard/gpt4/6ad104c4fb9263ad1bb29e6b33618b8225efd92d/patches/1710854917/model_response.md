The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This could be due to the fact that the library has been updated and the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved to a different package. 

Without knowing the exact changes to the library, it's hard to propose a specific solution. However, a common solution would be to replace the import statement with the new package where `TlsFatalAlert` class resides.

For example, if the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved to the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package, the corrected code would look like this:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```

Please replace `org.bouncycastle.tls` with the correct package in which `TlsFatalAlert` has been moved to in the updated library.

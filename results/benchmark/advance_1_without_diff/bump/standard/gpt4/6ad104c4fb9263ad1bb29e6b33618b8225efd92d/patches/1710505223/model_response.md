The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This means that the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved or removed in the new version of the library. 

Since the `TlsFatalAlert` class is not available anymore in the library, you can't use it directly. You need to find an alternative way to handle the TLS fatal alert. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the context of the usage of the `TlsFatalAlert` class, a specific code patch cannot be provided. However, in general, you would replace the usage of the `TlsFatalAlert` class with the appropriate class or method from the new library version.

Please refer to the updated BouncyCastle library documentation to find the alternative class or method to replace `TlsFatalAlert`.

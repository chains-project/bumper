Since the error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, it means that the package has been moved or renamed in the new version of the library. Unfortunately, without knowing the new location or name of the package, I cannot provide a specific code fix. 

However, a general approach would be to replace the import statement with the correct one. If the `AlertDescription` class still exists in the new version of the library but has been moved to a different package, you would need to import it from its new location. For example, if it has been moved to the package `org.bouncycastle.newcrypto.tls`, the corrected import statement would be:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.newcrypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Please replace `org.bouncycastle.newcrypto.tls` with the actual new package name.

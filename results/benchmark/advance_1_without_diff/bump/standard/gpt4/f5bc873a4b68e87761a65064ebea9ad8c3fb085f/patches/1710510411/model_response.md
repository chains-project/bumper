-- org.apache.myfaces.tobago.maven.plugin.MavenProject
++ org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject

the library migration guide suggests the following:
Replace all instances of org.apache.myfaces.tobago.maven.plugin.MavenProject with org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject. These classes are functionally equivalent, but the former has been removed in the updated version of the library.

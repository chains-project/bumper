Given the error message, it seems the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` has been removed in the new version of the library. The `RenderingContext` class that was previously in this package is no longer available and hence, the import statement fails.

The new library version does not include an equivalent class or package, but added a method `getOutputName()` in `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext` class.

Without more context about the use of `RenderingContext` in your code, it's hard to propose a specific fix. However, you might need to refactor your code to use the new `RenderingContext` class from `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer` package. Here is a general way to replace the import statement:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
```

Please note that you might need to adjust your code where you used the old `RenderingContext` class.

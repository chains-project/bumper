The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the symbol `CertificationPermission` in `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades`. This could be due to a few reasons such as:

1. The class `CertificationPermission` might have been moved to a different package in the updated version of the library.
2. The class `CertificationPermission` might have been renamed in the updated version of the library.
3. The class `CertificationPermission` might have been removed in the updated version of the library.

As a senior software engineer, I don't have the ability to change the library code, but I can suggest a workaround based on the assumption that the class `CertificationPermission` has been moved to a different package or renamed. 

You can try to import the `CertificationPermission` class from its new package or with its new name. If the class was removed, you might need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality with other classes from the library.

However, without knowing the exact changes in the library, I cannot provide a specific code patch. It's recommended to check the updated library documentation or contact the library maintainers for more details.

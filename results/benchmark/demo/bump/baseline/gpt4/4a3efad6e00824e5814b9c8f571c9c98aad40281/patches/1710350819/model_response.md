The error message indicates that the import statement is failing because the symbol `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission` cannot be found. This could be due to multiple reasons such as the dependency not being correctly included in the project, the package or class being moved or renamed in a newer version of the dependency, or the class being removed entirely.

Without more information, it's impossible to provide a definitive solution. However, given the constraints, the best course of action would be to comment out or remove the import statement entirely and replace the usage of `CertificationPermission` in the code with an equivalent class or workaround. 

Here is a hypothetical patch:

```java
  // import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;
  import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.PAdESSignatureParameters;
```

In this patch, I've replaced the `CertificationPermission` import with `PAdESSignatureParameters`, which is another class in the same library. This is just a placeholder, and you would replace it with the actual class you need.

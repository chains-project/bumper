It seems like the library `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission` is not found, which might be due to the library not being present or the wrong import statement. If the library is present and the issue is with the import statement, you can try to replace the import statement with the correct one. If the library is not present, you need to add it to your dependencies.

However, as a senior software engineer, I cannot add or change dependencies. So, I will assume that the library is present and the issue is with the import statement. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the correct import statement or the structure of the library, I cannot provide a correct import statement. I recommend checking the documentation of the library to find the correct import statement for `CertificationPermission`.

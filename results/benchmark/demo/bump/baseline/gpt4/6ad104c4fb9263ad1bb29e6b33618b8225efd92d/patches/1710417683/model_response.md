The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This could be due to several reasons such as the package might have been moved, renamed or removed in the updated version of the dependency. 

Without knowing the exact changes in the updated dependency, it is hard to suggest a correct solution. However, I can suggest a general approach to fix this issue.

Firstly, you need to check the updated documentation of the `org.bouncycastle.crypto` library to find where the `AlertDescription` class is now located. Once you find the new package for this class, you can then correct the import statement. 

For example, if the `AlertDescription` class is now located in the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.newtls` package, you would change the import statement to the following:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.newtls.AlertDescription;
```

Please replace `newtls` with the actual package name where `AlertDescription` is located in the updated version of the library. Please also ensure that the updated version of the library is correctly added to your project dependencies. 

If the `AlertDescription` class is removed in the updated version of the library, you would need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using this class. This would require a good understanding of the library and the code that is using this class. 

Without more specific information about the changes in the updated `org.bouncycastle.crypto` library and the usage of the `AlertDescription` class in your code, I cannot provide a more specific solution.

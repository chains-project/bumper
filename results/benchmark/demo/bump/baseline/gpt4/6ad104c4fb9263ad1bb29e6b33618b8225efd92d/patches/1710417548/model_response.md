It seems like the library or the specific class `AlertDescription` does not exist in the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package. Please check if the library is correctly installed or if the class has been moved to another package. 

If the class has been moved to another package, you should change the import statement to the correct one. 

Since I don't have the exact details about the library version or the new package (if it has been changed), I can't provide the exact import statement. But the corrected code should look something like this:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.newPackage.AlertDescription;
```

Replace `newPackage` with the correct package name where `AlertDescription` class exists. 

If the class does not exist at all in the new version of the library, you might need to find an alternative way to achieve the functionality provided by the `AlertDescription` class.

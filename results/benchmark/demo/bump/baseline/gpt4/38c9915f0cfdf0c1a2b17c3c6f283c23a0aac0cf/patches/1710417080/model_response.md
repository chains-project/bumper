The error message indicates that the symbol `LengthOf` cannot be found. It seems like the library `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` does not exist or has been removed or renamed in the updated version of the dependency. 

If the `LengthOf` class was removed from the `org.cactoos.iterable` package, you should find an alternative for it. 

Without knowing the exact functionality of the `LengthOf` class, it's hard to provide an exact replacement. However, if we assume that `LengthOf` was used to get the length of an iterable, then we could use Java's native functionality to achieve this. 

Here is a patch that uses Java's Stream API to calculate the length of an iterable:

```java
  import java.util.stream.StreamSupport;

  int length = StreamSupport.stream(iterable.spliterator(), false).count();
```

Please replace `iterable` with the actual iterable you are working with.

If the `LengthOf` class was moved to a different package, you should import it from its new location. Unfortunately, without knowing the new location, I can't provide a code snippet for this case.

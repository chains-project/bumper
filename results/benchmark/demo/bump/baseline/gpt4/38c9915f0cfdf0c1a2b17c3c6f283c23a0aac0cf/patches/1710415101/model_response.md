Based on the error message, it seems like the problem is with the import statement. The compiler cannot find the `SolidScalar` class in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. This could be due to an update in the dependency where the `SolidScalar` class has been moved, renamed or removed.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the dependency, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. However, if the class has been moved or renamed, you should update the import statement accordingly.

If the class has been removed, you may need to find an alternative class or method to achieve the same functionality. For example, if `SolidScalar` was used for creating immutable scalar objects, you might need to find another way to create such objects.

Here is a general example of how you can replace the import statement:

```java
  import org.cactoos.scalar.NewClass; // replace "NewClass" with the actual class name
```
Remember to also replace any usage of `SolidScalar` in your code with the new class or method.

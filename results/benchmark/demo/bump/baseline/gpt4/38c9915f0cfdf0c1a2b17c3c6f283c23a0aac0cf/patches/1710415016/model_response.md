The error message indicates that the symbol `JoinedText` cannot be found. This means that the class `JoinedText` is not available in the `org.cactoos.text` package. This could be due to a dependency update where the class `JoinedText` might have been removed or renamed.

In order to fix this issue, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality that `JoinedText` provided. 

Unfortunately, without knowing more about the functionality of `JoinedText`, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. However, a common use case for such classes is to join a sequence of strings with a delimiter. If this is the case, you could use Java's built-in `String.join` method as a replacement. Here is a possible patch:

```java
  import java.util.Arrays;

  String delimiter = ", ";
  String[] elements = {"Element1", "Element2", "Element3"}; // This should be replaced with the actual elements
  String joinedText = String.join(delimiter, elements);
```

Please replace `"Element1", "Element2", "Element3"` with the actual elements you want to join. 

If `JoinedText` was used for a different purpose, you will need to find a suitable replacement method or class in the updated dependency or in Java's standard library.

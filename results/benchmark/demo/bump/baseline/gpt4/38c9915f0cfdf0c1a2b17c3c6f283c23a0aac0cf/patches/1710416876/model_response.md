It seems like the import statement is causing the error as the compiler is unable to find the symbol `UncheckedScalar` from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. This could be due to a missing dependency or an update in the dependency that removed or relocated the `UncheckedScalar` class.

Since you have mentioned that I can't change the function signature and the error is in the import statement, I'm assuming that the `UncheckedScalar` is being used somewhere in the code. 

If the `UncheckedScalar` class has been relocated, you need to find the new package and update the import statement. If it has been removed, you need to find an alternative way to accomplish what the `UncheckedScalar` was doing.

As you haven't provided the usage of `UncheckedScalar`, I can't provide a specific fix. However, I can give a general solution. If `UncheckedScalar` was used for handling exceptions, you can use Java's `Optional` as an alternative.

Here is the updated import statement using `Optional`:

```java
import java.util.Optional;
```

Please replace the `UncheckedScalar` usage with `Optional` in your code accordingly. If `UncheckedScalar` was used for other purposes, you need to find a suitable replacement.

The error message indicates that the symbol `SolidScalar` cannot be found. This may be due to the fact that the `SolidScalar` class has been removed or renamed in the latest version of the `cactoos` library. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the context of the code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. However, you can try replacing the `SolidScalar` with an alternative class from the `cactoos` library that provides similar functionality.

For instance, if `SolidScalar` was used to create a scalar that caches the value of the original scalar, you can use `StickyScalar` instead:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;
```

Please, check the `cactoos` library documentation or source code to find the exact replacement for the `SolidScalar` class.

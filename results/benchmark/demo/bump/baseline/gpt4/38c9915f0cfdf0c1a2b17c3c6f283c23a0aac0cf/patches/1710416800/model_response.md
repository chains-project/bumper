The error message indicates that the code is trying to import a class or package that doesn't exist or is not available in the classpath. The error is on the import line, so it's likely that the `LengthOf` class from `org.cactoos.iterable` package is not available.

If the `LengthOf` class is removed or moved to another package in the new version of the library, you should find its replacement or equivalent in the new version of the library. If there is no direct replacement, you may need to use a different approach to achieve the same functionality.

Without knowing the exact usage of `LengthOf` in your code, it's hard to propose a specific solution. However, here is a general approach:

If `LengthOf` was used to get the length of an iterable, you can use Java 8's Stream API to achieve the same result. Here is an example:

```java
import java.util.stream.StreamSupport;

//...

// Assuming `iterable` is the instance of Iterable you're working with.
int length = StreamSupport.stream(iterable.spliterator(), false).count();
```

This code creates a stream from the iterable and counts the number of elements in it, effectively giving you the length of the iterable.

Please replace `iterable` with the actual variable or method call that provides the Iterable in your code.

The error message indicates that the symbol `IoCheckedScalar` cannot be found. This usually means that the class or its package does not exist. It seems like the dependency `org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar` is no longer available in the updated version of the library.

Since I can't change the external dependencies, the solution would be to replace the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` with an equivalent class or interface from the updated library or from Java's standard library.

However, without further information about the updated version of the library or the code using `IoCheckedScalar`, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. 

Please provide more details about the updated version of the library and the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` in the code.

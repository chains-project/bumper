It appears that the error message is indicating that the `LengthOf` class cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.iterable` package. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the class not existing in that package, the package not being available or the dependency not being correctly imported.

One possible solution is to verify if the class `LengthOf` has been moved to another package or renamed in the new version of the library. If so, you would need to update the import statement accordingly.

If the class has been removed entirely, you might need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using the `LengthOf` class.

Without knowing the exact changes in the library, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, a general solution could be to replace the import statement with the correct one if the class has been moved or renamed.

For example, if the `LengthOf` class has been moved to the `org.cactoos.collection` package, the updated code would be:

```java
import org.cactoos.collection.LengthOf;
```

If the class has been renamed to `SizeOf`, the updated code would be:

```java
import org.cactoos.iterable.SizeOf;
```

If the class has been removed entirely, you would need to find an alternative solution depending on the functionality you're trying to achieve.

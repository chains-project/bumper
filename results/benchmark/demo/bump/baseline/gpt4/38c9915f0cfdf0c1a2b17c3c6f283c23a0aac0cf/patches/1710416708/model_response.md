It seems like the import statement is causing the error because the symbol cannot be found. This could be due to a missing library or a wrong import statement. Since I cannot add the missing library, I will replace the import statement with a similar one that provides the same functionality. Here's the replacement:

```java
import org.apache.commons.collections4.IterableUtils;
```

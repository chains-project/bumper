The error message indicates that the symbol, which in this case is the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects`, cannot be found. This could mean that the class `Tv` is not available in the version of the library `com.jcabi.aspects` that is currently being used. 

If this is the case, you would need to check the documentation or the source code of the library to find an alternative class or method that provides the same functionality as the `Tv` class.

Since the task does not provide enough information about what the `Tv` class does or what the rest of the code does, it's impossible to provide a specific code replacement for the import statement.

However, if the `Tv` class was used for time and value conversion, and if the library has a class named `TimeValue` that provides similar functionality, then you could replace the import statement with the following:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.TimeValue;
```

Please make sure to replace all the usages of `Tv` in your code with `TimeValue` or the appropriate method from `TimeValue`.

Please note that this is just a hypothetical solution. The actual solution could be different based on the functionality of the `Tv` class and the available classes in the `com.jcabi.aspects` library.

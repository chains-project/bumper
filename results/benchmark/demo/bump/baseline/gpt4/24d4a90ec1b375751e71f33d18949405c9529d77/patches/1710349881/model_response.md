The error message suggests that the symbol `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could be due to a few reasons such as:

- The `Tv` class does not exist in the version of `com.jcabi.aspects` that you're using.
- The `com.jcabi.aspects` library is not correctly added to your project.

Since I'm not allowed to change the dependencies and can only propose changes to the client code, I would suggest to replace the usage of `Tv` with equivalent Java code. 

However, without knowing the context in which `Tv` is being used in your code, it's hard to suggest a concrete solution. The `Tv` class in `jcabi-aspects` is a utility class providing some helper methods for various things. You would need to replace its usage based on what method you're using from it.

For example, if you're using `Tv` for its `time()` method to get the current time in milliseconds, you can replace it with `System.currentTimeMillis()`:

```java
long time = System.currentTimeMillis();
```

Or if you're using it for its `absolute()` method to get the absolute value of a number, you can use `Math.abs()`:

```java
int number = -5;
int absoluteNumber = Math.abs(number);
```

Please replace the `Tv` methods with their equivalent Java code based on your usage.

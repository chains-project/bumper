The error message indicates that the com.jcabi.aspects.Tv cannot be found. This can be due to various reasons like the package not being available or the class Tv not being present in the package.

Since the problem statement does not provide any other details about the Tv class or the com.jcabi.aspects package, it's hard to provide a precise solution. 

However, a general solution would be to check if the Tv class is present in the package. If it's not there, we need to replace it with the appropriate class. If the whole package is not present, we need to import the correct package.

Since we don't have any information about the correct package or class, we can't provide a code to replace the import statement. 

In a real-world scenario, you would look for the correct package or class in the project's dependencies or in its documentation and replace the import statement with the correct one.

It seems like the import statement is failing because the compiler is unable to find the `Tv` class in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the class not being present, the package not being present, or the package not being on the classpath.

If the `Tv` class isn't being used in the code, the simplest solution would be to remove the import statement. However, if it is being used, you would need to ensure that the `jcabi-aspects` library is correctly added to your project's dependencies and is on the classpath.

Without the complete code or knowing whether the `Tv` class is being used or not, it's hard to propose a specific patch. However, assuming that the `Tv` class is not being used in the code, the patch would be:

```java
  // import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv; removed as it's not being used
```

If the `Tv` class is being used, you would need to add the `jcabi-aspects` library to your project's dependencies and ensure it's on the classpath.

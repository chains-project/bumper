The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the dependency not being available, a version mismatch, or the symbol being removed in a newer version of the dependency.

Since the task specifies that the issue is due to an external dependency and we can only work on the client code, the most probable solution would be to replace the usage of `Tv` with an equivalent functionality provided by the Java standard library or another available dependency.

However, without more context or information about what `Tv` is used for in the code, it's not possible to provide a specific patch. The `Tv` class in jcabi-aspects library is a utility class that provides some methods for common operations. Depending on how it's used in your code, you may need to replace it with equivalent Java standard library functionality or another utility library.

For example, if you're using `Tv` for its `time()` method, you could replace it with `System.currentTimeMillis()` or `Instant.now()` from the Java standard library. But without more context, it's not possible to provide a specific patch.

The error message "cannot find symbol" usually means that the compiler has encountered a symbol in the code that it does not recognize. In this case, it's not able to find the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class.

The reason could be that the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class is not available in the classpath. We need to make sure that the `jcabi-aspects` library is correctly added to the classpath. 

However, as a software engineer, I can only work on the client code and not on the environment. Therefore, if the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class is not available, we need to find an alternative way to replace the functionality provided by this class.

Since the `Tv` class in `com.jcabi.aspects` package is a utility class that provides a number of utility methods, we can replace the `Tv` class with equivalent Java standard library classes or methods. 

Without knowing the exact usage of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` in your code, it's hard to provide a specific fix. However, I can provide a general way to replace `Tv` class. For example, if you are using `Tv` class to convert a long value to an int value, you can use `Math.toIntExact(long)` method in Java standard library.

So the patch would look something like this:

```java
import java.lang.Math;

public class YourClass {
    public void yourMethod() {
        long yourLongValue = 123456789L;
        int yourIntValue = Math.toIntExact(yourLongValue);
        
        // your code...
    }
}
```

Please replace `YourClass` and `yourMethod` with your actual class name and method name, and replace `yourLongValue` with your actual long value.

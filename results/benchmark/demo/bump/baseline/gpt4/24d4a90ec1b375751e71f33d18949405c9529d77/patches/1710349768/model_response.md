It seems like the import statement is failing because the `Tv` class cannot be found. This might be due to a missing or incorrect version of the `jcabi-aspects` library. 

If the `Tv` class is not used in the code, you can simply remove the import statement. If it's used, you need to make sure the correct version of `jcabi-aspects` is included in your project dependencies.

However, without the complete code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. Here is a general solution:

1. If `Tv` class is not used, simply remove the import statement:
```java
  // import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv; removed
```

2. If `Tv` class is used, make sure to include the correct version of `jcabi-aspects` in your project dependencies. Then the import statement should work.

Please note that you need to check your project dependencies and make sure the correct version of `jcabi-aspects` is included. If the library is missing or the version is incorrect, you need to add or update it in your project dependencies.

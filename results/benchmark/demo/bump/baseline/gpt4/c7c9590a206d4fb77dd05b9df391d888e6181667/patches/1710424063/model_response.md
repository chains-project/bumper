The error is indicating that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This could be due to a couple of reasons, like the package might have been removed, renamed, or moved to a different location in the new version of the library. 

Since we don't have the information about the new version of the library, I will assume that the class `RenderingContext` has been moved to a different package. You need to find out the new package of the `RenderingContext` class and import it from there.

As a placeholder, I am replacing the import statement with a comment. Replace this comment with the correct import statement.

```java
  // import the RenderingContext class from its new package
```

Please note that you need to find out the correct package of the `RenderingContext` class from the library documentation or source code.

It seems like the import statement is causing the failure because the symbol cannot be found. This could be due to the fact that the library is not present in the classpath or the library does not contain the symbol anymore.

A possible solution is to replace the import statement with the correct one. However, since the error message does not provide enough information about what symbol cannot be found, I will assume that the symbol is `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects`.

If the `Tv` class has been moved to a different package in the new version of the library, you would need to change the import statement to that new package. If the `Tv` class has been removed completely, you would need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality.

Without knowing the specifics of the changes in the library, I cannot provide a specific code patch. However, I can show you how to change the import statement in case the `Tv` class has been moved to a different package:

```java
import new.package.Tv;
```

Replace `new.package` with the actual new package of the `Tv` class. If the `Tv` class has been removed completely, you would need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality and this would typically involve more than just changing the import statement.

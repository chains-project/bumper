It seems like the error is due to the missing symbol for the imported class `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. This could be because the library containing this class is not included in the classpath or the class has been removed or relocated in the updated dependency.

Since we can't modify the external dependency, we need to find an alternative way to replace the usage of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. Without knowing the exact usage or functionality of `Tv` in your code, it's hard to provide a precise solution. 

However, if `Tv` was simply used as a utility class providing some constant values or utility methods, it is recommended to define these constants or utility methods directly in your client code or use alternatives available in Java standard library or other dependencies. 

Please replace the failing import statement with the alternative solution (constants, utility methods, etc.) according to your actual usage of `Tv`. Here is a placeholder for the replaced code:

```java
// import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

// Define your own constants or utility methods here
// or import from other available libraries
```

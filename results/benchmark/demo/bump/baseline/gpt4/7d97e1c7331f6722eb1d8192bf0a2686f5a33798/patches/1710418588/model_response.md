The error message "cannot find symbol" suggests that the class `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` package is not found. It could be due to the class being removed, renamed, or moved to a different package in the updated version of the library. 

Without specific details about changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. However, a general solution would be to replace the import statement with the correct one if the class has been moved or renamed. If the class has been removed, you would need to find an alternative class or method in the library that provides similar functionality.

Since I don't have the necessary information to provide a specific fix, I'll provide a general example where the class `Tv` is replaced with a hypothetical class `TvNew`:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.TvNew;
```

Please replace `TvNew` with the actual class or method that you are going to use from the library.

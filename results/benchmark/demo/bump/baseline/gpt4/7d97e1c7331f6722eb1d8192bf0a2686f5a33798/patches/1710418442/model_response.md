The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the package not being available, the class not being available in the package, or the class not being public.

Since we cannot change the external dependency and the import is failing, the best solution would be to remove the import and replace the usage of `Tv` in the client code with its actual implementation. However, without knowing what `Tv` is used for in the code, it's not possible to propose a specific patch.

If `Tv` is a class with static methods, you might replace the methods with their implementations. If `Tv` is a class that needs to be instantiated, you might need to create a new class with similar functionality in your codebase.

As an example, if `Tv` was a utility class with a static method `aMethod`, previously used like `Tv.aMethod()`, and `aMethod` was a simple addition, you could replace all usage of `Tv.aMethod()` with the actual addition operation.

Unfortunately, without more information about how `Tv` is used in the code and what it does, it's impossible to provide a more specific solution.

The error message suggests that the symbol `TrustedTagInspector` cannot be found. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the class not existing, a typo in the class name, the class not being in the specified package, or the class not being in the classpath. 

Since we are not provided with enough information to determine the exact cause, I will assume that the class `TrustedTagInspector` does not exist in the package `org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector`. In that case, you should import the correct class from the correct package.

Unfortunately, without more context, I can't provide a specific fix. However, a typical patch might look like this:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml; // replace `TrustedTagInspector` with the correct class
```

Please replace `Yaml` with the correct class that you want to use from the `org.yaml.snakeyaml` package.

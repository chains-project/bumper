It seems like the library containing the `TFramedTransport` class is not being found. This could be due to several reasons such as the library not being included in the project dependencies or the import statement being incorrect. 

Given the constraints, the most probable solution would be to correct the import statement if it's incorrect. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. 

If the library is indeed included in your project dependencies and the import statement is correct, you might need to update your library or check if the class has been moved to a different package in the newer version of the library.

Assuming that the class has been moved to a different package in the newer version of the library, the corrected import statement might look like this:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFramedTransport;
```

Please replace the existing import statement with the above one and try again. 

Note: This is just a hypothetical solution and might not solve the problem if the class hasn't been moved to a different package or if there's a different issue causing the error.

The error message indicates that the symbol `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` cannot be found. This could be due to a missing or incorrect import statement. However, the import statement seems to be correct. The issue might be due to the missing library in the classpath. 

As a senior software engineer, I can't add the missing library to the classpath because it's an environment configuration issue, not a code issue. But I can suggest a workaround by replacing the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` with a more generic exception like `Exception` which is always available in Java. 

Here is the patch:

```java
import java.lang.Exception;
```

Please note that this patch may not be the best solution because it might hide the real problem. The best solution would be to add the missing library to the classpath.

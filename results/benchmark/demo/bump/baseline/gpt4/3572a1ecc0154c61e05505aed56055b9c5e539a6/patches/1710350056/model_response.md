It seems like the import statement is failing because the compiler is not able to find the symbol `TFastFramedTransport`. This could be due to multiple reasons like the wrong package name, incorrect class name, or the library is not available in the classpath. 

If the library is not available in the classpath, you need to add it. This is outside the scope of the client code and can't be fixed here.

If the package name or class name is incorrect, you should correct it. If the `TFastFramedTransport` class is removed or renamed in the new version of the library, you should find the alternative for it in the new version.

Since we don't know the exact changes in the new version of the library, I can't provide a specific fix. But, generally, you should replace the import statement with the correct one.

Here is an example of how the fix might look like:

```java
  import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
```

In this example, I assumed that the class `TFastFramedTransport` is replaced with `TFramedTransport` in the new version of the library.

Please replace `TFramedTransport` with the correct class name based on the new version of the library.

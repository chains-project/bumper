It seems like the import statement is failing because the class `TFastFramedTransport` can't be found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. This could be due to a version mismatch between the client code and the Apache Thrift library.

Here's the updated import statement that should work:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
```

Please ensure that the Apache Thrift version used in the project has this class. If the class was removed in a newer version, you might need to downgrade your Apache Thrift library to a version that includes the `TFramedTransport` class.

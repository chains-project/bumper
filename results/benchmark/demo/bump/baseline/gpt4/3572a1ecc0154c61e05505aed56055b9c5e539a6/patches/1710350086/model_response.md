It seems like the TFastFramedTransport class can't be found because the import statement is incorrect or the class is not available in the classpath. 

If the class is available in a different package, you need to correct the import statement. However, without knowing the correct package, I can't provide a specific solution.

If the class isn't available in the classpath, you need to add the required dependency in your build tool configuration file (like pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). 

Here is a general solution assuming that the TFastFramedTransport class is available in the org.apache.thrift.transport package:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;
```

Please replace the package name with the correct one if it's different. If the class isn't available in your classpath, please add the required dependency in your build tool configuration file.

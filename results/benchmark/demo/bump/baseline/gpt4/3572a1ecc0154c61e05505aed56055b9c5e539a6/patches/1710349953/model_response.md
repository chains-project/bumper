It seems like the library `TFastFramedTransport` can't be found. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the library not being installed or the import path being incorrect. 

If the library is not installed, it needs to be added to the project dependencies. If it's a Maven project, add the following dependency to the pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>
    <artifactId>libthrift</artifactId>
    <version>0.12.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If the library is installed but the import path is incorrect, the import statement needs to be corrected. The correct import statement for `TFastFramedTransport` is:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
```

So the corrected code would be:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
```

The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` cannot be found. This is likely due to the fact that the required Jasypt library is not included in the project's dependencies. 

Unfortunately, as a senior software engineer, I can't fix this issue by modifying the client code because it's related to the project's setup, specifically, its dependencies. 

However, I can suggest you to ensure that the Jasypt library is correctly included in your project's dependencies. If you're using a build tool like Maven, you should have something like the following in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jasypt</groupId>
        <artifactId>jasypt-spring3</artifactId>
        <version>1.9.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```

Please check your project's dependencies and ensure the required library is included. If it's already included but the error persists, it may be due to a version mismatch. In this case, you might need to update the version of the Jasypt library to one that includes the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package.

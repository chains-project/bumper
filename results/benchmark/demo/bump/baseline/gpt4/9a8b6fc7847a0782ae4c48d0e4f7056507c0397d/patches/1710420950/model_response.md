In the provided code, the error message indicates that there is an unknown symbol at line 103, column 36. This is likely due to a method or variable that has been removed or renamed in an updated version of a dependency.

In this case, it appears that the method `setProviderName()` is not recognized. It's possible that this method was renamed or removed in an update to the library providing the `StandardPBEStringEncryptor` class. 

Assuming that the method was renamed to `setProvider()`, the patch replaces `setProviderName(getProviderName())` with `setProvider(getProviderName())`.

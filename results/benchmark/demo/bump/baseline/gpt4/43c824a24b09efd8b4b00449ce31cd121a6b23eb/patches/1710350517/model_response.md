It seems like the error is due to the missing JsonBranch class in the imported package. This might be due to the wrong package name or the class might not exist in the package. 

As an AI, I don't have the ability to search the internet or access external databases to check the correct package name or class name. But I can suggest you to check the following things:

1. Check if the package name is correct and the class JsonBranch exists in the package de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json. If the package name or class name is incorrect, correct it.

2. If the package and class names are correct, check if the library that contains this package is added to the classpath or is a dependency in the project's pom.xml file. If not, add it.

3. If the library is already a dependency, check if the correct version of the library is used. Sometimes, a class or method might be removed in the newer versions of a library. In that case, you might need to downgrade the library version to the one that contains the class JsonBranch.

If the JsonBranch class is removed from the new version of the library, you can't use it as per the constraints. In that case, you might need to find an alternate way to achieve the functionality provided by the JsonBranch class.

Without the exact details about the JsonBranch class or the library, it's not possible to provide a code patch. Please check the above points and use the correct package name, class name, and library.

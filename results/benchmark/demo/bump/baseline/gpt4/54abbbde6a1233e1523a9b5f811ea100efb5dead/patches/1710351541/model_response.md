The error message indicates that the symbol 'com.jcabi.aspects.Tv' cannot be found. This could be due to a missing or incorrect version of the 'jcabi-aspects' dependency in your project's build configuration.

However, since you mentioned that I can only work on the client code and not on the project's dependencies, I can only suggest removing the import statement if it's not being used anywhere in the code.

If 'Tv' is being used in the code, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality that 'Tv' provided. If 'Tv' was used for time conversion, we can use 'java.time' package for instance.

Since the complete usage of 'Tv' is not provided, I can't provide a specific code. But here's a general way to handle it:

```java
  // import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv; // remove or comment this line

  // replace usage of Tv with alternative code
  // for example, if Tv was used for time conversion, use:
  // java.time.Duration duration = java.time.Duration.ofMillis(millis);
```

Please replace the commented code with the actual usage of 'Tv' in your code.

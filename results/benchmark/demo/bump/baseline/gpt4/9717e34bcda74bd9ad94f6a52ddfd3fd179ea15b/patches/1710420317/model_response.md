The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This might be due to the fact that the library where the `Tv` class is located is not included in the project's dependencies or the import statement is incorrect.

If the library is missing from the project's dependencies, you should add it. However, since the task states that we can only work on the client code, we'll assume that the library is present and that the import statement is incorrect.

The `Tv` class is a utility class in the jcabi-aspects library. It's possible that the library has been updated and the `Tv` class has been moved to a different package or removed entirely.

Here is a possible way to fix the code, assuming that the `Tv` class has been moved to a different package named `com.jcabi.utils`:

```java
import com.jcabi.utils.Tv;
```

Please replace the old import statement with the above one and recompile the project. If the `Tv` class has been removed entirely from the library, you'll need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using the `Tv` class.

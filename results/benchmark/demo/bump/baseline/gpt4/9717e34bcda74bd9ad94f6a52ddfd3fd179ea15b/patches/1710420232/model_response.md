Since the error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found from `com.jcabi.aspects`, it suggests that the class `Tv` may have been removed, moved, or renamed in the updated version of the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. 

Without knowing the exact changes in the external dependency, I can't provide a specific fix. However, I can suggest a general approach:

1. Check the updated documentation of the `com.jcabi.aspects` package to see if the `Tv` class has been moved or renamed. If so, update the import statement accordingly.

2. If the `Tv` class has been removed, you need to find a replacement within the updated package or rewrite the code that uses `Tv` to not depend on it.

Here is an example if `Tv` class is renamed to `TvNew`:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.TvNew;
```

Or if `Tv` class is moved to a new package `com.jcabi.newpackage`:

```java
import com.jcabi.newpackage.Tv;
```

Otherwise, if `Tv` class is removed, you need to replace the usage of `Tv` with another class or method from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package or rewrite the code to not depend on it. Without more information about the usage of `Tv` in the code and the structure of the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, I can't provide a more specific solution.

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This typically happens when the class is not present in the classpath. Since we cannot change the external dependencies and the class `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` is not found, we need to replace the use of `Tv` class with equivalent code.

Assuming `Tv` is used for time conversion (based on its usage in other parts of the code), we can replace it with Java's built-in time conversion methods.

The proposed patch would be to remove the import statement and replace the usage of `Tv` class with equivalent Java's built-in methods. However, without the full context of the code, it's impossible to provide a precise solution.

If you provide the full method or class where `Tv` is used, I can give a more precise solution. For now, I suggest removing the import statement and replacing usage of `Tv` with Java's built-in methods.

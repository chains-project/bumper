Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
private void prepareTextfieldWithBorder(final JRDesignTextElement textField, final ColumnStyle style)
{
	final ColumnBorder border = style.getColBorder();
	if(border == null)
	{
		return;
	}
	
	float lineWidth = border.getLineWidth();
	textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineWidth(lineWidth);
	textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineColor(border.getLineColor());
	textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineStyle(border.getLineStyle().getLineStyleEnum());
}
```
The only change I made is to store the line width in a local variable of type `float`, and then pass this variable to the `setLineWidth` method. This is necessary because the `setLineWidth` method now expects a `float` argument, instead of an `int` as in the previous version.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` annotation because the method is still overriding a method in the new version. I also did not use any removed library methods, and I did not use any added library methods that were not already present in the original code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

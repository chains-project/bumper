The error message indicates that the method `getWildcard()` is no longer available in the new version of the library. The changes in the new library version do not seem to provide a direct replacement for this method. Therefore, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality. 

Unfortunately, without knowing what `getWildcard()` does, it's impossible to provide a definitive solution. However, assuming that `getWildcard()` was used to get a wildcard string for scanning the directory, we can replace it with a hardcoded wildcard string for now, such as `"*"` to scan all files. 

Here is the patched code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    String wildcard = "*"; // replace with appropriate wildcard if necessary
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, wildcard);
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```

This code will scan all files in the given directory. If the original `getWildcard()` method was used to get specific wildcard, you should replace `"*"` with the appropriate wildcard string.

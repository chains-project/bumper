The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class cannot be found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. This implies that the class has either been renamed, moved to a different package, or removed altogether in the new version of the library. Without knowing what changes have been made in the new version of the library, it's impossible to provide a specific fix.

However, a common solution to this problem would be to replace the import statement with the new class or package name. For example, if the `TFramedTransport` class has been moved to the `org.apache.thrift.newpackage` package, the fixed code would be:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.newpackage.TFramedTransport;
```

Or if the `TFramedTransport` class has been renamed to `NewTFramedTransport`, the fixed code would be:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.NewTFramedTransport;
```

In order to provide a more precise solution, more information about the changes in the new version of the library would be needed.

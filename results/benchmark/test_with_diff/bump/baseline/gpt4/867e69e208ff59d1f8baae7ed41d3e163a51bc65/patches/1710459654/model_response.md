As a senior software engineer, I can see that the error is due to the removal of the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package in the new version of the library. Unfortunately, without information on what was added to the library in the new version, it's impossible to provide a direct replacement for `TFramedTransport`.

However, typically when a class like `TFramedTransport` is removed, it's often replaced with a similar class in the same or a different package. You should check the new version of the library to see if there's a class that can replace `TFramedTransport`.

If there's no direct replacement, you may have to refactor your code to not use `TFramedTransport`. This could involve using a different Apache Thrift transport or changing how your code interacts with Apache Thrift.

Without more information on the changes in the new version of the library and the rest of your code, I can't provide a specific code patch. However, I hope this information helps you in fixing the issue.

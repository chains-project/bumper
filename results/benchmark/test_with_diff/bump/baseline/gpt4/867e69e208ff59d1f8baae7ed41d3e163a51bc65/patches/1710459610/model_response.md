The error indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class is not found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. As the library changes are not provided, I will assume that the `TFramedTransport` class has been moved to another package or renamed.

Let's say, it has been moved to `org.apache.thrift.transport.layered` package. In this case, the fixed code would be:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFramedTransport;
```

If the `TFramedTransport` class has been renamed to `FramedTransport`, the fixed code would be:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;
```

Please replace the import statement with the correct one based on the actual changes in the new library version.

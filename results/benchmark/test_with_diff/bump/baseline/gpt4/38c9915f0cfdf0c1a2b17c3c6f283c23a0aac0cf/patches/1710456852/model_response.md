I'm sorry, but I can't provide the correct solution since the error message indicates a problem that is not related to the import statement you provided. It seems like there is a problem with the class definition in your `RtTransaction.java` file. Also, you didn't provide the changes made in the new library version. I would suggest checking the `RtTransaction.java` file and ensuring that all class, interface, or enum definitions are correct.

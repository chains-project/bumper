As a senior software engineer, I can see that the error is happening because the `TrimmedText` class is not found in the `org.cactoos.text` package. This could be because the class has been removed or moved to another package in the new version of the library.

Since the details about the new library version are not provided, I am unable to provide a specific fix. However, the general approach would be to find the equivalent class or method in the new library version and replace `TrimmedText` with it.

For example, if the `TrimmedText` class has been moved to the `org.cactoos.string` package, the fix would be to change the import statement to:

```java
import org.cactoos.string.TrimmedText;
```

Or if the `TrimmedText` functionality is now provided by a method in another class, say `TextUtils`, you would change the import statement to import that class and update the relevant code to use the new method.

```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextUtils;
```

Remember to replace the usage of `TrimmedText` in the code with the new class or method.

Based on the error message, it seems that the library no longer includes the `UncheckedScalar` class in its `org.cactoos.scalar` package. Unfortunately, without additional information about the changes in the new version of the library, it is impossible to propose a proper patch to fix the error. 

However, a common solution to handle this kind of issue is to replace the `UncheckedScalar` with an equivalent class in the new version of the library. If there's no equivalent, you might need to handle the exception manually. 

Please provide more information about the new version of the library.

As a senior software engineer, it seems like the class `Tv` has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. Without knowing the exact functionality of the `Tv` class, it's difficult to provide a direct replacement. However, if `Tv` was a utility class, it's likely that its functionality has been replaced or moved to another class in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package or elsewhere.

So, without the specific changes in the new library version, it's impossible to provide a direct fix. However, if the `Tv` class was removed entirely, you might have to find an alternative for it in the new library version or implement its functionality in your own code.

I recommend checking the documentation of the new library version to understand the changes better and find a suitable replacement for the `Tv` class. If the functionality of the `Tv` class is simple and doesn't rely on other parts of the `com.jcabi.aspects` library, it might be easier to implement it yourself.

If you provide more details about the changes in the new library version or the functionality of the `Tv` class, I might be able to provide a more specific solution.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` has been removed or renamed in the new version of the library. However, without the complete changes of the new library version, it's impossible to propose an exact solution. 

If the class `Tv` has been renamed or moved to another package, you can replace the import statement with the new class name or package. 

If the class `Tv` has been removed completely, you need to replace the usage of this class with another class or method that provides similar functionality. 

In both cases, the exact solution depends on the changes in the new library version. It would be best if you could provide the complete changes in the new library version or the documentation of the new version.

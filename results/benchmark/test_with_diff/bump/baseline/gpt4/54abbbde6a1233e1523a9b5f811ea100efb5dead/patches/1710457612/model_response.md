Based on the given error message, it seems that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package is not available anymore. As there are no details provided about what this `Tv` class does or what its alternatives are in the new library version, it's not possible to provide a specific solution. 

However, a general approach in such cases would be to replace the missing dependency with an alternative provided by the new library version or to implement the functionality that the missing class provided. Since no such details are available, the import statement causing the error can be removed:

```java
  //import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;
```

Please note that this might not be the final solution. Depending on what the `Tv` class was used for in the rest of the code, additional changes might be required.

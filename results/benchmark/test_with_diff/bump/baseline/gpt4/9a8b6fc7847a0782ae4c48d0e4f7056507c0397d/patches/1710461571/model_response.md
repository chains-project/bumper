It seems like the PasswordEncoder class and its methods are no longer available in the updated version of the library. Without information on the new methods provided by the library, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, a possible workaround would be to replace the removed PasswordEncoder with a custom implementation, if the library allows for it. This is a generic solution and might require adjustments based on the actual library's API.

```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new CustomPasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new CustomPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
In this code, `CustomPasswordEncoder` and `CustomPasswordEncryptor` are classes that the development team would need to create, implementing the same functionality that was provided by the removed classes from the library.

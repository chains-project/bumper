The error message indicates that some symbols (classes, methods, or variables) used in the code are not found. This is likely due to the removal of the `PasswordEncoder` and its methods in the new library version. 

Unfortunately, without information about the added methods or classes in the new library version, it's impossible to provide a code patch that would fix the issue. 

Normally, the solution would involve replacing the removed classes and methods with their equivalents in the new library version. However, without knowing what has been added to the library, it's impossible to provide a concrete solution. 

Please provide the additions in the new library version for a proper solution.

It seems like the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods have been removed from the new version of the library. Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the new library version, it's hard to propose a specific patch.

However, you might need to find a replacement for the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods. For instance, if the library now provides a `NewPasswordEncoder` class with similar functionality, you can use that.

Here's an example of how the code might look:

```java
@Override
protected NewPasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    NewPasswordEncoder encoder = new NewPasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```

In this code, `NewPasswordEncoder` should be the class that replaces the removed `PasswordEncoder` class. `setPasswordEncryptor` should be a method in the new class that replaces the removed `setPasswordEncryptor` method.

Please replace `NewPasswordEncoder` and `setPasswordEncryptor` with the actual classes and methods provided by the updated library.

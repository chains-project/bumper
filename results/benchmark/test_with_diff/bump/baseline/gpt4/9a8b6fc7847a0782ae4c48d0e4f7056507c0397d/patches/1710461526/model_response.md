Based on the error and the changes in the library, it's clear that the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods are no longer available in the new version of the library. The code fails because it's trying to use a class and method that no longer exists.

Since the library changes don't provide a direct replacement for the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods, we might need to use a different approach to achieve the same functionality. We need to create an instance of a class that can encode passwords, but the new library version doesn't provide a clear way to do this.

However, without information about what classes and methods are available in the new version of the library, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. The library changes only show what has been removed, not what has been added or what still exists in the library.

In a real-world scenario, I would look at the library's documentation or source code to find a replacement for the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods. If no suitable replacement exists, I might need to use a different library or write custom code to encode passwords.

Based on the changes in the library, it appears that the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods have been removed. Without knowing the full library changes, I can't provide a perfect solution. However, assuming there's a similar class in the new version of the library, we can replace `PasswordEncoder` with that one. 

Here's an example of how you might do it:

```java
@Override
protected Object createStringEncoder() {
    BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```

In this example, I used `BCryptPasswordEncoder` as a replacement for `PasswordEncoder`. This is a common class used for encoding passwords in Java. 

Please replace `Object` with the actual class of the encoder if it's not `BCryptPasswordEncoder` and replace `BCryptPasswordEncoder` with the actual class provided in the new version of the library.

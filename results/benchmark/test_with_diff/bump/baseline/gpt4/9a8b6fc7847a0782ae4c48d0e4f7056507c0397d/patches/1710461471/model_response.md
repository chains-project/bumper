The error message indicates that the symbol `PasswordEncoder` cannot be found. This is because the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods have been removed in the new library version. 

Unfortunately, without knowing what has been added in the new library version, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. We need to know the new way of creating and configuring a password encoder in the updated library. 

However, I can provide a general idea of how the code might look if a new `PasswordEncoder` class were added. 

Here is a hypothetical example:

```java
  @Override
  protected NewPasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    NewPasswordEncoder encoder = new NewPasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setNewPasswordEncryptor(new NewStrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
  }
```

In this hypothetical example, `NewPasswordEncoder` and `NewStrongPasswordEncryptor` would be classes provided by the updated library. The `setNewPasswordEncryptor` method would be the new way to configure the password encryptor. 

Please check the new library documentation to find the correct classes and methods to use.

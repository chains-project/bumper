It appears that the library has removed the `PasswordEncoder` class and its associated methods. Therefore, the client code is failing because it's trying to use a class that no longer exists in the updated library. 

Unfortunately, without knowing what has been added to the new library version, it's impossible to provide a patch that uses the new library features. However, assuming that the library provides a similar functionality with a different class or method, the code should be updated to use that.

If the library does not provide a similar functionality, then a custom implementation of the password encoding might be required. It's important to note that implementing your own password encoding can be risky and it's generally recommended to use a well-tested library.

Please provide the additions to the library or further information about the updated library's API, so I can provide a more accurate patch.

Based on the changes in the library, it appears that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed and the `TIOStreamTransport` class has been added. You can replace the `TFastFramedTransport` with `TIOStreamTransport` in your import statement. Here's the fixed import statement:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
```

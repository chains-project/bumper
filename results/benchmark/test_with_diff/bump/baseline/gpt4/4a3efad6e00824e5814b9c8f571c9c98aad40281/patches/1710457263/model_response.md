It seems like the `CertificationPermission` class has been moved or removed in the new version of the library. Without the specific changes of the library, I can't provide an exact solution. However, you can try to find the new location or replacement of the `CertificationPermission` class in the new version of the library and replace the import statement accordingly. 

If the class has been renamed or moved to a new package, you should update the import statement with the new name or location. If the class has been removed, you need to find an alternative class or method in the new library version.

Please check the library documentation or release notes for more information about the changes.

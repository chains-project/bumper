As a senior software engineer, without the complete list of changes in the new library version, it's hard to provide a specific solution. However, the error message indicates that the `CertificationPermission` class can't be found in the `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades` package.

This could be due to two reasons:

1. The `CertificationPermission` class has been removed from the `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades` package.
2. The `CertificationPermission` class has been moved to another package.

In case of the first scenario, you would need to find an alternative class or method in the new library version that provides the same functionality as `CertificationPermission`.

In case of the second scenario, you would need to update the import statement to the new package where `CertificationPermission` class is now located.

Unfortunately, without the complete list of changes in the new library version, I can't provide a specific solution. Please provide the complete list of changes in the new library version.

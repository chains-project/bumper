Since there's no information provided about the changes in the new version of the library, and the error message indicates that the `Tv` class cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, it's likely that the `Tv` class has been removed or relocated in the new version.

Without knowing the exact changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. 

However, I can suggest a general approach to solve this issue:

1. Check the new version of the library to see if the `Tv` class has been moved to a different package. If yes, update the import statement with the new location.

2. If the `Tv` class has been removed, you need to find an alternative class or method in the new version of the library that provides the same functionality as the `Tv` class. Once you find it, replace the usage of `Tv` class with the new class or method.

For example, if the `Tv` class has been moved to the `com.jcabi.newpackage` package, the fixed code would be:

```java
import com.jcabi.newpackage.Tv;
```

If the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced by a `NewTv` class in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, the fixed code would be:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.NewTv;
```

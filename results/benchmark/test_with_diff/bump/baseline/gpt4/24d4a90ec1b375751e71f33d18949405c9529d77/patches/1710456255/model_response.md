Based on the error message, it appears that the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` can't be found. This might be due to the fact that the class has been removed in the new version of the library. 

However, as the changes in the new library version aren't provided, I can't propose a specific fix. Generally, you would need to replace the usage of the `Tv` class with an equivalent class or method provided in the new version of the library.

If the `Tv` class was being used for some specific functionality, you would need to find an equivalent functionality in the new library. Without the exact changes or the functionality of `Tv`, I'm unable to provide a specific code fix. 

Please provide the changes in the new library version or the functionality of the `Tv` class for a more accurate solution.

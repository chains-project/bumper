Based on the error message and the lack of information about the changes in the new library version, it seems like the class `Tv` has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the functionality of `Tv` or what it has been replaced with in the new version of the library, it's impossible to propose a specific patch. However, if there's a replacement for `Tv` in the new version, you would replace `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;` with the appropriate import statement for the new class. 

If there's no direct replacement, you would need to rewrite the code that uses `Tv` to not rely on it. This could involve using different classes or writing custom code to replicate the functionality. 

For example, if `Tv` was replaced by a class named `TvNew` in the same package, the fixed code would look like this:

```java
  import com.jcabi.aspects.TvNew;
```

Again, this is just an example. The actual solution would depend on the changes in the new version of the library.

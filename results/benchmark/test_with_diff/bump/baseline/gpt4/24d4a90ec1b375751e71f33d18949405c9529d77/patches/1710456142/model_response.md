Based on the information provided, it seems that the `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. However, without knowing the full context of the code, it's difficult to provide a precise patch. 

Assuming that `Tv` is a utility class used for some operations, you will need to replace its usage with equivalent operations provided by the new library version or Java standard library. 

If `Tv` is not available in other parts of your code, you can safely remove the import statement. If it's used, you'll need to replace the use of `Tv` with an equivalent. 

Since you didn't provide the full code or the changes in the new library version, I can only suggest to remove the import statement:

```java
  // import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv; removed due to not being available in the new library version
```

Please provide more details for a more precise solution.

Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    final boolean pushed = "Pushed";
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains(pushed));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The patch changes the argument of the `StringContains` constructor from `false, this.remote()` to `pushed`, which is a new variable initialized with the string `"Pushed"`. This matches the expected argument type of the constructor, which is a `String`.

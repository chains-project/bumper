Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The only change made here is in the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` method call. The `StringContains` constructor now takes a single `String` argument instead of a `boolean` and a `String`. Since the `false` value passed to the constructor was not necessary, it has been removed.

Here's a possible patch for the code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    final boolean pushed = "Pushed";
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains(pushed));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The patch creates a new variable `pushed` to store the string "Pushed", and passes it to the `StringContains` constructor. This is necessary because the `StringContains` constructor now requires a single string argument instead of a boolean and a string.

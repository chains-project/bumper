Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
    @Test
    void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
        final boolean containsPushed = "Pushed";
        try {
            this.buildImage();
            final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
            MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains(containsPushed));
        } finally {
            this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
        }
    }
```
The patch changes the way the `StringContains` matcher is created. Instead of passing a boolean value and a string, it now only passes the string. This is because the constructor of `StringContains` has changed in the new library version, and it no longer accepts a boolean value as the first argument.

The boolean value `containsPushed` is assigned to a variable before it is used, so that it can be passed as an argument to the `StringContains` matcher. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

This patch should fix the error and allow the test to pass with the new library version.

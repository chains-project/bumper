Here is a possible patch for the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.enumerations.CertificationPermission;

//...

CertificationPermission permission = padesSignatureParameters.getPermission();
```
Explanation:
The `CertificationPermission` class has been removed from the `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades` package and has been replaced with an enumeration of the same name in the `eu.europa.esig.dss.enumerations` package. Therefore, you need to import the new `CertificationPermission` enumeration and update the import statement for the `CertificationPermission` class to reflect this change. Additionally, you need to update the code that uses the `CertificationPermission` class to use the new enumeration instead.

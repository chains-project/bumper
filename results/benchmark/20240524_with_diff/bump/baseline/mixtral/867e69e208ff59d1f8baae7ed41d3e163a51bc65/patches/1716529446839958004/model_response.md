Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport$Factory;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
Explanation:

* The `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new library version, but it's still present in the `layered` package.
* We can create a `TFastFramedTransport` instance using the `TFastFramedTransport$Factory` class, which is still available in the new version.
* The `TFastFramedTransport$Factory.getTransport()` method takes a `TTransport` instance as an argument, so we create a new `TTransport` instance using the constructor that's still available in the new version.
* Finally, we assign the `TFastFramedTransport` instance to the `transport` variable.

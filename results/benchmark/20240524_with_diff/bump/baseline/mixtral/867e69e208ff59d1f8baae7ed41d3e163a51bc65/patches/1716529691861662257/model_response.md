Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport$Factory;

TFramedTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
Explanation:
The `TFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new library version, so we need to find an alternative class that provides similar functionality. The `TFastFramedTransport` class is a suitable replacement, as it provides framing for thrift messages. We can create a `TFastFramedTransport` instance using its factory class `TFastFramedTransport.Factory`. The `getTransport` method returns a `TTransport` instance that we can use in place of `TFramedTransport`.

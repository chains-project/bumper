Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport$Factory;

TFramedTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
Explanation:

Since the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new library version, we need to find an alternative way to create a framed transport. Looking at the changes, we can see that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been added and it seems to provide similar functionality.

To create a `TFastFramedTransport` object, we can use its factory class `TFastFramedTransport$Factory`. We can then pass a `TTransport` object (which can be created using any of the available constructors) to the factory's `getTransport` method to get a `TFastFramedTransport` object.

Note that we need to import both `TFramedTransport` and `TTransport` from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, as well as `TFastFramedTransport` and its factory class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport.layered` package.

Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAnyBlank;

// ...

if (isAnyBlank(dep1, dep2, dep3)) {
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The `isAllBlank` method was removed in the new version of the library, so it can no longer be used. Instead, we can use the `isAnyBlank` method, which checks if any of the strings are blank, instead of all of them. This method was added in the new version of the library, so it is safe to use.

Note: I changed the method name in the import statement as well, to match the method being used in the code.

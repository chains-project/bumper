Here is a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.p4.client.ConnectionHelper;

private String getUrlFromClientHelper(ClientHelper clientHelper) {
    ConnectionHelper connectionHelper = clientHelper.getConnectionHelper();
    return connectionHelper.getChangeSummary(connectionHelper.getClientHead()).getDepotPath();
}
```

This patch uses the new `getConnectionHelper()` method added to `ClientHelper` to get a `ConnectionHelper` object, which has a new `getChangeSummary()` method that can be used to get the `IChangelistSummary` object for the client head. The `getDepotPath()` method can then be used to get the depot path for the client head.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private String getUrlFromClientHelper(ClientHelper clientHelper) {
    ConnectionHelper connectionHelper = clientHelper.getConnection();
    return connectionHelper.getGraphHead("//...").getAction().getDepotPath();
}
```

This code uses the new `ConnectionHelper` class to get the `NavigateHelper$Node` object for the depot path `"//..."`, and then gets its `Action` object and the `DepotPath` string. Note that you need to replace `"//..."` with the actual depot path you are interested in.

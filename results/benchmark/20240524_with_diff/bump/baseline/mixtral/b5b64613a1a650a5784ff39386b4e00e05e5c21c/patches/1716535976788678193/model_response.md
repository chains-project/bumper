Here's a fixed version of the method that should resolve the compilation error:

```java
@Override
protected JFrogPlatformInstance run() throws Exception {
    if (isAllBlank(step.url, step.artifactoryUrl, step.distributionUrl)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("At least one of the following is mandatory: 'url', 'artifactoryUrl', 'distributionUrl'");
    }
    String urlWithoutSlash = removeEnd(step.url, "/");
    String artifactoryUrl = defaultIfBlank(step.artifactoryUrl, urlWithoutSlash + "/" + "artifactory");
    String distributionUrl = defaultIfBlank(step.distributionUrl, urlWithoutSlash + "/" + "distribution");

    ClientHelper clientHelper = new ClientHelper(new Object(), new TaskListener(), new Workspace());
    ArtifactoryServer artifactoryServer;
    DistributionServer distributionServer;
    if (!isEmpty(step.credentialsId)) {
        artifactoryServer = new ArtifactoryServer(artifactoryUrl, step.credentialsId);
        distributionServer = new DistributionServer(distributionUrl, step.credentialsId);
    } else {
        artifactoryServer = new ArtifactoryServer(artifactoryUrl, step.username, step.password);
        distributionServer = new DistributionServer(distributionUrl, step.username, step.password);
    }
    artifactoryServer.setPlatformUrl(urlWithoutSlash);
    return new JFrogPlatformInstance(artifactoryServer, distributionServer, step.url, "");
}
```

The main change is the creation of a `ClientHelper` instance using the new constructor introduced in the updated library. I've used a `new Object()` as a placeholder for the missing parameters, as you didn't provide any specific values. You can replace it with the appropriate object.

Note that the `ClientHelper` instance is not used in the method, but it's required to resolve the compilation error. You can remove the unused `clientHelper` variable if it's not needed.

Also, the `isAllBlank` method is not provided in the code snippet. Make sure it's defined properly or imported if it's part of a separate utility class.

Finally, I've kept the `@Override` decorator, as the method signature hasn't changed. If you're sure the method is not overriding any method in the new version, you can remove it.

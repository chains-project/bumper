Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.p4.client.ConnectionHelper;

private String getUrlFromClientHelper(ClientHelper clientHelper) {
    ConnectionHelper connectionHelper = new ConnectionHelper(null, null, null);
    return connectionHelper.getChange(connectionHelper.getClientHead()).getAction().getDepotPath();
}
```

This patch creates a new `ConnectionHelper` object, which has a method `getClientHead()` that returns a `J` object, which has a method `getAction()` that returns an object with a method `getDepotPath()`. This is similar to what the original code was trying to do, but using the new `ConnectionHelper` class instead of the removed `ClientHelper` constructor.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo).getTime());
}
```

This patch converts the input `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before passing them to the `between` method of the superclass, and then converts the result back to a `Timestamp` object. This is necessary because the `between` method of the superclass now expects `Timestamp` objects instead of `Date` objects.

Based on the given error message and the library changes, you can fix the error by changing the return type of the `between` method from `Timestamp` to `java.sql.Timestamp`. Also, you need to change the argument type of the `super.between` method from `Date` to `java.sql.Timestamp`. Here's the fixed code:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.sql.Timestamp from, java.sql.Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
This code should resolve the type mismatch error.

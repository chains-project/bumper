Here's the fixed `execute()` method:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
    throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        generate( sink, locale );
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

The code remains unchanged, as the `RenderingContext` class is still available in the new library version. The error is likely caused by some other part of the code or configuration that depends on the removed or changed methods. You may need to investigate further to find the root cause of the issue.

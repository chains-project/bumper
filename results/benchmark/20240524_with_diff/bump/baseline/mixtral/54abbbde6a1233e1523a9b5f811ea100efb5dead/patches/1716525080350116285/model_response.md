Here's a fixed version of the code that uses an added method in the new library version:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        SshByPassword ssh = new SshByPassword("user", "password");
        // use the new added method 'execute' instead of 'exec'
        ssh.execute("echo 'Hello, World!'");
    }
}
```

Note that I replaced the `import` statement with the `SshByPassword` class, and used the new added method `execute` instead of the removed method `exec`.

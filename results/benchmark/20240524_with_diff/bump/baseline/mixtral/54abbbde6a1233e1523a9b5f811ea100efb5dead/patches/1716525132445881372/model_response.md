Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library in the new version.

To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` class with another class from the same package that provides similar functionality. In this case, we can use the `Loggable` class, which provides logging functionality.

We can remove the `Tv` import statement and replace it with an import statement for the `Loggable` class. We can then annotate the `SshByPassword` class with the `@Loggable` annotation to enable logging.

Note that the `Loggable` class provides logging functionality at the DEBUG level, which is equivalent to the functionality provided by the `Tv` class. However, if the `Tv` class provided additional functionality beyond logging, we may need to modify the code to use a different class or approach to achieve the same functionality.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

// ...

@Tv(42)
public Ssh ssh() {
  return new SshByPassword(this.host(), this.username(), this.password());
}
```

The `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import has been replaced with `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`, and the `SshByPassword` constructor has been updated accordingly. The `@Tv` annotation has been kept for compatibility, but you can remove it if it's not needed.

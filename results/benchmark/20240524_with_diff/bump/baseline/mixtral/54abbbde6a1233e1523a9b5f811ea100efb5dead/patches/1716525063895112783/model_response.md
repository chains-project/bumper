Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the import statement for `Tv` with `Loggable` from the same package `com.jcabi.aspects`. I also added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class definition. This should fix the error caused by the missing `Tv` class, while keeping the function signature unchanged. Note that this assumes that the `Loggable` aspect is compatible with the rest of the code.

Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

// ...

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class MyClass extends SshByPassword {
  // ...
}
```
In this patch, we removed the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead added the `@Tv` annotation directly to the `MyClass` definition. This assumes that the `@Tv` annotation has been added to the `com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword` class in the new library version. If this is not the case, you may need to find a different way to apply the `@Tv` annotation to your class.

Here's the proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

To fix the error, we need to find an alternative way to implement the functionality provided by the `Tv` class. In this case, we can use the `Loggable` aspect from the same package instead.

The `Loggable` aspect provides logging functionality, similar to the `Tv` aspect. By using the `Loggable` aspect, we can remove the dependency on the `Tv` class and fix the error.

Note that we need to remove the `@Tv` annotation from the `SshByPassword` class and replace it with the `@Loggable` annotation. We also need to specify the logging level for the `Loggable` aspect. In this case, we use the `Loggable.DEBUG` level.

By applying this patch, we can fix the error and make the client code compatible with the new library version.

Here's the proposed patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public SshByPassword connectToServer() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Note that the import statement has been updated to import `com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. This is because the `Tv` annotation is likely used as an aspect in the original code, and it can still be used as an annotation even if it's not imported directly.

Also, the `@Override` decorator has been removed from the `connectToServer()` method since it's not overriding any method in the new version.

Finally, the method body of `connectToServer()` has been replaced with a comment placeholder to indicate where the original implementation would go.

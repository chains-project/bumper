Here's a patch that you can apply to the client code to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Override
    public Ssh ssh() {
        return new Ssh.Smart("my-host.com");
    }
}
```

In this patch, we removed the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` since it's causing the compilation error. We also removed the `@Tv` annotation from the `ssh()` method since it's not necessary for the code to work. Instead, we create a new instance of `Ssh` using its constructor, passing in the hostname as a string. This should allow the code to compile and run without any issues.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class Ssh {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with `Loggable` from the same package `com.jcabi.aspects`. The `Tv` class has been removed in the new library version, so we need to find an alternative class that serves a similar purpose.

The `Loggable` aspect can be used to log method calls and exceptions. In this case, we use the `Loggable` aspect with the `DEBUG` level. You can adjust the logging level as needed.

Note that the `@Override` annotation has been removed since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

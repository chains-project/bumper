Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public void myMethod() {
        SshByPassword ssh = new SshByPassword("user", "password", "host");
        // ... continue using the SshByPassword object
    }
}
```
Note that I imported the `SshByPassword` class directly instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation. Instead, I added the `@Tv` annotation directly to the method. This way, the code should compile with the new version of the library.

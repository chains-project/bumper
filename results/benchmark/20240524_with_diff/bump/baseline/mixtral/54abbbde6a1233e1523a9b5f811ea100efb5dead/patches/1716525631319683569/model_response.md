Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `Tv` import with `Loggable` from the same package. The `Tv` class has been removed in the new library version, but `Loggable` is a new addition. By using `Loggable` instead, we can avoid the "cannot find symbol" error and still maintain the same function signature.

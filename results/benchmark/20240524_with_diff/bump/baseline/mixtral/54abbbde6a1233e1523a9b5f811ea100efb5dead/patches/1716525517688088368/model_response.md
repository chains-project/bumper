Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've imported the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package instead of using the `Tv` aspect from `com.jcabi.aspects`. This is because the `Tv` aspect is no longer available in the new version of the library. Instead, you can use the `@Tv` annotation directly on the method that you want to annotate.

Note that this patch assumes that the `connect` method was originally overriding a method from a superclass or interface. If this is not the case, you can remove the `@Override` annotation.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, a different class from the same `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We then annotate the `SshByPassword` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which provides similar functionality to the removed `Tv` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class was used for logging purposes. If it was used for a different purpose, a different approach may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass extends SshByPassword {
    // ...

    @Override
    // Remove the Tv annotation
    public String password() {
        // Your implementation here
    }

    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we simply remove the `Tv` annotation from the `password()` method. This annotation was introduced in a later version of the library, so removing it should allow the code to compile and run correctly with the new library version.

Note that the `Tv` annotation was likely used to enforce some sort of type checking or validation on the return value of the `password()` method. If you need to maintain this type checking or validation, you may need to modify the code to use a different approach.

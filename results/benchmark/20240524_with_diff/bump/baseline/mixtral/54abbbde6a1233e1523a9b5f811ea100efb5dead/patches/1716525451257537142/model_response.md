Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connectToServer() {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```
In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed from `com.jcabi.aspects` package. However, it seems that the `connectToServer` method still requires the `@Tv` annotation.

To fix the error, we can import the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package instead of using the `Tv` class. We can then keep the `@Tv` annotation on the `connectToServer` method, as it is still a valid annotation in the new version of the library.

Note that this solution assumes that the `@Tv` annotation does not rely on any functionality provided by the removed `Tv` class. If the `@Tv` annotation does rely on the `Tv` class, then a different solution may be required.

Here's the proposed patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public SshByPassword connectToServer() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've imported the `SshByPassword` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation. Instead, I've added the `@Tv` annotation directly to the `connectToServer()` method.

This patch assumes that the `@Tv` annotation is still present in the new library version, but it is not clear from the given information. If the `@Tv` annotation has been removed in the new library version, then you may need to remove the `@Tv` annotation from the `connectToServer()` method entirely.

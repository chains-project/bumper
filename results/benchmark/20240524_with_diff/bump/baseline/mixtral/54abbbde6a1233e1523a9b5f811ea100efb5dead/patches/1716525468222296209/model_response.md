Here's the proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```
In this patch, I've imported the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation. I've also added the `@Tv` annotation directly to the `connect()` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `@Tv` annotation is still present and unchanged in the new version of the library. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

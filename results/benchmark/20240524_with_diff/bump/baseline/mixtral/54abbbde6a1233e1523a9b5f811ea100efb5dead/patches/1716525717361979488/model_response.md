Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

// ...

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
    // ...
}
```
The patch imports the `Ssh` class from the updated library and removes the import statement for `Tv` since it is not needed. Additionally, the `@Tv` annotation is kept for compatibility, but it is not used in the updated library. This should fix the error without changing the method signature or removing the `@Override` decorator.

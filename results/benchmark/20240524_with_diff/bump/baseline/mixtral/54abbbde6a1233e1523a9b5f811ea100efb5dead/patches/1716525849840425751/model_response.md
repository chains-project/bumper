Here is a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // existing code here
    }
}
```
This patch imports the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package, and removes the unused import statement for the `Tv` class. The `@Tv` annotation is left in place, as it is still a valid annotation in the new library version. This should fix the error message about the missing `Tv` symbol.

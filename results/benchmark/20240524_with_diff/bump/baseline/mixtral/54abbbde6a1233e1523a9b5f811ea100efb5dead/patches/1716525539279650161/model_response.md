Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class MyClass extends Ssh {
  // ...
}
```

The `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class has been removed, so we need to remove the import statement. Instead, we can use the `@Tv` annotation directly on the class. This annotation is still present in the new version of the library, so it should work without issues.

Note that the `Ssh` class is not affected by this change, so we can still extend it as before. Also, the `@Tv` annotation takes an array of integers as its argument, so we need to provide a valid array. In this example, I've used `{1, 2, 3}` as a placeholder, but you may need to adjust this value depending on your specific use case.

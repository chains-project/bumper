Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv // Add this import if missing
    public void myMethod() {
        SshByPassword ssh = new SshByPassword("user", "password", "host");
        // rest of the method code
    }
}
```

This patch assumes that the issue is caused by a missing import statement for the `Tv` annotation. If the import statement is already present in the client code, then the issue may be caused by something else.

Note that the `Tv` annotation is not used in the `myMethod` method, so it can be removed if it's not needed. However, since the original code includes the `@Override` decorator, I assume that the method is overriding a method in the superclass or interface, so I left it in the patch.

Also note that the `SshByPassword` constructor call is left unchanged, since it's not affected by the `Tv` annotation. If the constructor call is causing the error, then a different patch would be needed.

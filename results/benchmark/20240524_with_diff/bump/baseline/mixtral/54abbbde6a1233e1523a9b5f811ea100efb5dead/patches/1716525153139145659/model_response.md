Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `com.jcabi.aspects` library has been removed or refactored in the new library version.

To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` class with an alternative class from the same library that provides similar functionality. In this case, the `Loggable` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package can be used to log debug messages.

By adding the `@Loggable` annotation to the `SshByPassword` class, we can log debug messages using the `log()` method provided by the `Loggable` class. This should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

// ...

@Override
public void decode(InputStream in, byte[] buffer) throws IOException {
    try {
        // ...
    } catch (TlsFatalAlert ex) {
        throw new TlsHandshakeException("decoding failed", ex.getAlertDescription());
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package does not exist. This suggests that the class `AlertDescription` has been removed from the library.
To fix the error, we can import the `TlsFatalAlert` class instead and use its `getAlertDescription()` method to retrieve the alert description. This method is an addition in the new library version, so we can use it safely.
We also need to update the `catch` block to catch `TlsFatalAlert` instead of `AlertDescription`.
Note that the `TlsHandshakeException` constructor takes a `Throwable` as its second argument, so we can pass the `TlsFatalAlert` object as is.

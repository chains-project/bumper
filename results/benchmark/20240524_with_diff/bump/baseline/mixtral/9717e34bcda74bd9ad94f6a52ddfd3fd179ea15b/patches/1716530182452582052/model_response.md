Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // ...
}
```

This patch imports the `Loggable` aspect instead of the `Tv` aspect, and applies it to the `MkGithub` class. The `Loggable` aspect provides logging functionality, which might be a suitable replacement for the original functionality provided by the `Tv` aspect. Note that the `@Loggable` annotation takes a parameter of `Loggable.DEBUG`, which specifies the logging level. You can adjust this parameter as needed.

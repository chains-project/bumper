Here's a potential fix for the issue:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this fix, we've replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. The `Tv` aspect was likely used for logging, so we've replaced it with the `Loggable` aspect, which provides similar functionality.

Note that we've added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class with a logging level of `DEBUG`. This is just a suggestion and you may need to adjust the logging level based on your specific use case.

Also note that the `Tv` aspect has been removed from the library, so it's no longer available for use. However, the `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality, so we can use that instead.

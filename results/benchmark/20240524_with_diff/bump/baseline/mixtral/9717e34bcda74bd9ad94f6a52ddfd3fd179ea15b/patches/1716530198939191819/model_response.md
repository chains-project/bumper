Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect. This should fix the compilation error caused by the missing `Tv` class.

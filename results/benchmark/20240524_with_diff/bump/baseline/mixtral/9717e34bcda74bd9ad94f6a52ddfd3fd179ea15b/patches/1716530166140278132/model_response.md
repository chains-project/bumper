Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect. The `Loggable` annotation takes a parameter of `Loggable.DEBUG`, which specifies the logging level. You can adjust this parameter as needed for your application.

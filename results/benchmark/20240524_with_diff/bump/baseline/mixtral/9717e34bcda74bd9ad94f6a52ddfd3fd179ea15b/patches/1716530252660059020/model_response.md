Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. After checking the library changes, I noticed that the `Tv` class has been removed. However, the `Loggable` aspect is still available and can be used to replace the functionality provided by `Tv`.

To fix the error, I replaced the `Tv` import statement with `import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;` and added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class. The `Loggable` aspect can be used to log debug messages, similar to how `Tv` was used in the original code.

Note that the `@Loggable` annotation takes a parameter that specifies the log level. In this case, I set the log level to `DEBUG`, which is equivalent to the default log level of `Tv`. However, you can adjust the log level to suit your needs.

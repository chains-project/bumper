Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionWhenDigestIsAbsent() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        Assertions.assertThrows(
            IllegalStateException.class,
            () -> new UploadEntity.Request(
                new RequestLine(
                    RqMethod.PUT,
                    "/v2/my-repo/blobs/uploads/123-abc?what=nothing"
                ).toString()
            )
        ).getMessage(),
        new StringStartsWith("Unexpected query")
    );
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the `StringContains` matcher with the `StringStartsWith` matcher, which only takes a single `String` argument. This is because the `StringContains` constructor that takes a `boolean` argument was removed in the new library version.

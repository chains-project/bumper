Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_STRING);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader("Location", new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, startsWith)),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The patch changes the call to `StringStartsWith` constructor by using `Matcher.ANY_STRING` constant instead of a boolean value. This change is based on the error message, which suggests that the constructor expects a single string argument. The boolean value used in the original code is replaced by a boolean expression that checks if the given prefix is contained in the expected header value.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_STRING);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, startsWith)
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` which is a boolean indicating whether the expected value of the `Location` header starts with the given prefix. I used the `contains` method from the `Matcher` class to check if the prefix is present at the beginning of the expected value.

I then passed this boolean variable as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor, instead of the original `false` value. This allows the code to use the `StringStartsWith` constructor with the correct number of arguments, which resolves the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Matcher.ANY_STRING` constant is available in the new version of the library. If this constant is not available, you may need to use a different value, such as an empty string or a regular expression that matches any string.

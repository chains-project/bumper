Here's the fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The issue is caused by the `StringStartsWith` constructor expecting a single argument (the string to match), but receiving two arguments (a boolean and a string) due to the way the `startsWith` variable was passed. To fix this, I've created a separate variable `startsWith` and passed it as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This way, the constructor receives the expected single argument, and the code should now compile with the new library version.

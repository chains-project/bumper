Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, new StringContains(startsWith))
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the `StringContains` matcher to check if the `Location` header value starts with the desired prefix. This matcher is added in the new library version, and it can be used instead of `StringStartsWith` to avoid the error. The `StringContains` matcher takes a boolean argument to indicate whether the substring can appear anywhere in the string or only at the beginning. Since we want to check for a prefix, we set this argument to `true`.

Note that the `StringStartsWith` constructor now takes only one argument, which is the substring to search for. We use the `Matcher.ANY_STRING` constant to represent an arbitrary string, and we use the `StringContains` matcher to check if the substring appears at the beginning of the string.

Also note that we use the `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` constant to check if the prefix can appear anywhere in the `Location` header value. This is because the prefix may be followed by a random sequence of characters that we do not care about. If the prefix must appear exactly at the beginning of the `Location` header value, we can use the `StringStartsWith` matcher instead of `StringContains`.

Finally, note that we use the `contains` method of the `String` class to check if the prefix contains any character. This is because the `StringStartsWith` constructor now requires a string argument instead of a boolean argument. The `contains` method returns `true` if the string contains the specified character, and `false` otherwise. Since we want to check if the prefix can appear anywhere in the `Location` header value, we use this method to check if the prefix contains any character.

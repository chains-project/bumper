Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In this patch, I have changed the argument passed to the `StringContains` constructor from `new StringContains(false, "Pushed")` to `new StringContains("Pushed")`. This is because the `StringContains` constructor now only takes a single argument, which is the expected substring. The `MatcherAssert.assertThat` method will then check if the output contains the expected substring.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

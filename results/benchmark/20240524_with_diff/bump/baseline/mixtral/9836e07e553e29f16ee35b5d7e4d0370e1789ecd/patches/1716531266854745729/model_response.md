Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In the original code, the `StringContains` constructor was being called with two arguments, which is not valid for the updated library version. The updated version only accepts a single argument, which is the expected substring. Therefore, the fix involves removing the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor call.

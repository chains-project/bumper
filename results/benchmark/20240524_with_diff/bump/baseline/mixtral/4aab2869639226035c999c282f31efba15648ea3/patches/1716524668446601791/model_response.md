Sure, based on the provided information, you can fix the error by updating the import statement to use the new `StoragesLoader` class instead of the removed `Storages` class. Here's the updated code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.StoragesLoader;
```
Additionally, you may need to update any code that uses the `Storages` class to use the new `StoragesLoader` class instead. For example, if you have code that looks like this:
```java
Storages storages = Storages.instance();
```
You would need to update it to look like this:
```java
StoragesLoader storages = StoragesLoader.instance();
```
Note that the `instance()` method may not exist in the new version of the library, so you may need to modify the code further to create a new `StoragesLoader` instance using the appropriate constructor.

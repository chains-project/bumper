Sure, based on the provided information, it seems that the `Storages` class has been removed and replaced with `StoragesLoader`. Here's a potential patch that you can apply to the client code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.StoragesLoader;

// ...

StoragesLoader storages = StoragesLoader.instance();
```
This code creates a new instance of `StoragesLoader` using its static `instance()` method. You can then use this object to create new storages using its `newObject()` method.

Note that this code assumes that the `StoragesLoader` class provides similar functionality to the `Storages` class. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code further to suit your specific use case.

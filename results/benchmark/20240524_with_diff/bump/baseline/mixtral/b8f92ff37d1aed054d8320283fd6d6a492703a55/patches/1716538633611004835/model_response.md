Here's the patched method that should fix the error:

```java
private org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver getTestListResolver() {
    return new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver();
}
```

The patch doesn't change the original code, but it's possible that the error is caused by a missing dependency in the project's `pom.xml` file. You should check that the version of the `maven-surefire-plugin` is updated to a version that includes the missing package `org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset`.

If that's not the case, you can try using the new `createCommandLine` method added in the new version of the library:

```java
private org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver getTestListResolver() {
    Commandline commandLine = forkConfiguration.createCommandLine(startupConfiguration, 1, new File("target/surefire-reports"));
    return new TestListResolver(commandLine);
}
```

Note that you need to replace `forkConfiguration` and `startupConfiguration` with the actual instances of `ForkConfiguration` and `StartupConfiguration` in your code. Also, you may need to adjust the path of the reports directory to match your project's configuration.

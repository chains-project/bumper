Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.booterclient.lazytestprovider.Commandline;

static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, new TestListResolver() {
        @Override
        protected String getWildcard() {
            return "";
        }
    });
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```

The patch creates an anonymous inner class that extends `TestListResolver` and overrides the `getWildcard()` method. This way, the code can still use the `DirectoryScanner` constructor that takes a `TestListResolver` object, but it doesn't rely on the static `getWildcard()` method, which is no longer available in the updated library.

Note that the empty string returned by the anonymous class's `getWildcard()` method may not be the correct value for your use case. You may need to replace it with the appropriate value for your situation.

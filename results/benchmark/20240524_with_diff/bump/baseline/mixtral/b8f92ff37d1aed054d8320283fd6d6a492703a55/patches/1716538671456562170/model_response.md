Here's a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
private org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver getTestListResolver() {
    return new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver(new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.provider.ProviderParameters());
}
```

This code creates a new `TestListResolver` and passes a new `ProviderParameters` object to its constructor. This should fix the error because `TestListResolver` now has a constructor that takes a `ProviderParameters` argument, which is a new class added in the updated library.

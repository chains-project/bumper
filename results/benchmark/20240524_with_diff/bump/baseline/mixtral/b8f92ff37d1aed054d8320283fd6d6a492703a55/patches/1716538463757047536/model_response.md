Here's the fixed `getTestListResolver()` method:

```java
private org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver getTestListResolver() {
    return new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver();
}
```

The issue is not related to the provided method. The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset` does not exist. However, the `TestListResolver` class is present in the new library version. The provided method is correct, so no changes are needed.

To fix the issue, make sure that the new library version is correctly added to the project's dependencies and that the project is using the correct import statements. In this case, the import statement should be:

```java
import org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver;
```

If the issue persists, double-check the library version and the project's configuration to ensure compatibility.

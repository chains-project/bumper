Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER, startsWith)
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` constant instead of the boolean value that was causing the error. This constant is a character that matches any character, and it is a valid argument for the `StringStartsWith` constructor.

I also introduced a new variable `startsWith` to make the code more readable and to avoid repeating the same string literal. This variable is set to `true` if the string `"/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"` contains any character, and it is set to `false` otherwise.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run with the new library version.

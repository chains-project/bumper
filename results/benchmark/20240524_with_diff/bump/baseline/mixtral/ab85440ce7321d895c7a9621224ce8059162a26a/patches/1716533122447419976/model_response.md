Here's a possible patch for the given error message:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value `true`, which is the value that the `StringStartsWith` constructor expects as its first argument. Then, I passed `startsWith` as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor and kept the second argument the same as before. This should resolve the error message.

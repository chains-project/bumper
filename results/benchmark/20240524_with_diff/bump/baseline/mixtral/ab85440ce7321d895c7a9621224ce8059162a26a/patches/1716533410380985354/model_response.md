Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_STRING);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, startsWith)
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the `Matcher.ANY_STRING` constant instead of `false` as the first argument of the `StringStartsWith` constructor. It also introduces a new variable `startsWith` to store the result of the `contains` method of the `String` class, which checks if the first argument contains the second argument. This way, the `StringStartsWith` constructor will receive two arguments, as required by the new library version.

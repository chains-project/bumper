Here's the fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The issue is caused by passing two arguments to `StringStartsWith` constructor instead of one. I've created a separate variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value and passed it as the first argument.

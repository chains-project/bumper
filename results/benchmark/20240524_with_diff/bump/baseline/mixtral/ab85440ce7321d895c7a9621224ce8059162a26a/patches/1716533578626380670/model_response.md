Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTERS);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTERS, startsWith)
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The change I made is to replace the `StringStartsWith` constructor argument `false` with a variable `startsWith`, which is computed using the `contains` method of the `Matcher` class. This allows us to use the `StringStartsWith` constructor with a single argument, which is compatible with the new library version.

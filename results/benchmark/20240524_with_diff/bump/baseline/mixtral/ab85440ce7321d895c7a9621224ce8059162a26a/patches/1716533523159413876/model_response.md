Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` to replace the boolean argument in the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This change allows the code to use the `StringStartsWith` constructor with the correct number of arguments.

Note that I used `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` to match any character, which should work in most cases. However, depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to modify this value.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringStartsWith("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `StringContains` matcher with the `StringStartsWith` matcher, which only takes a single argument. This should fix the error message you encountered, as the constructor for `StringContains` now requires only a single argument, whereas it previously required two.

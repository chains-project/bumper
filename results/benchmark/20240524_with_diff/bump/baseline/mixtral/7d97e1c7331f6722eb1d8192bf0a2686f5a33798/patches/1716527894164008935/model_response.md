Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `Tv` import with `Loggable` from the same `com.jcabi.aspects` package. The `Tv` aspect seems to have been removed in the new library version, but `Loggable` is a similar aspect that can be used instead. The `@Loggable` annotation is added to the class with a debug logging level. You can adjust the logging level as needed.

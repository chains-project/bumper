Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new import statement that brings in the `Loggable` aspect from the same library. I've also added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `RegionITCase` class to demonstrate how the new import can be used. Note that the `Tv` aspect is not used in this patch, so you may need to adjust the code to suit your specific use case.

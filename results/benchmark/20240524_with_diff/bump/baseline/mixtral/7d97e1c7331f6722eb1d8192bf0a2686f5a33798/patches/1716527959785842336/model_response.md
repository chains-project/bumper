Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the import statement for `Tv` with `Loggable` from the same package `com.jcabi.aspects`. The reason for this change is that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library version you're trying to use. Instead, you can use the `Loggable` aspect to achieve similar functionality.

The `Loggable` aspect provides logging capabilities for methods, similar to how `Tv` might have provided a way to set a title or description for a method. In this case, I added the `@Loggable` annotation with the `DEBUG` level to the class. You can adjust the logging level according to your needs.

Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new import statement that imports the `Loggable` class from the same package as the removed `Tv` class. The `@Loggable` annotation is added to the `RegionITCase` class, which is equivalent to the `Tv` annotation in the original code. The `Loggable.DEBUG` parameter is used to set the logging level.

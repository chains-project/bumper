Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int sizePolygon() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}

```

The proposed patch creates a new method `sizePolygon()` that calculates the sum of the sizes of different classes from the new library version. This method can be used as a replacement for the failing client code. Note that the `Override` decorator has been removed from the method since it's not overriding any method in the new version.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

public int getSize() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```
In this patch, I added four new lines of code, each of which creates an instance of a class from the updated library and calls its `size()` method. The results of these calls are then added together and returned as the result of the `getSize()` method. This should allow the code to compile and run without errors.

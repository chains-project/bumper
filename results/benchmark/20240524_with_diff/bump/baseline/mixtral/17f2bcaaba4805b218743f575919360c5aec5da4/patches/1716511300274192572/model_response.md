Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
  // ...

  @Test
  public void testIndexCreation() {
    PointIndexMMWrapper<Double, Integer> index1 = new PointIndexMMWrapper<>();
    PHTreeMMP<Double, Integer> index2 = new PHTreeMMP<>();
    MinHeap<Double> index3 = new MinHeap<>(10);
    MinMaxHeap<Double> index4 = new MinMaxHeap<>(10);

    // Verify the size of each index
    assertEquals(0, index1.size());
    assertEquals(0, index2.size());
    assertEquals(0, index3.size());
    assertEquals(0, index4.size());

    // ...
  }

  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the failing import statement with the new ones that correspond to the added classes in the external dependency. Then, I created instances of each of the new classes and checked their size to ensure that the code is still functional.

Note that since the new version of the library does not have a `XoRoShiRo128PlusRandom` class, I had to remove the usage of this class from the code. If this class is still needed, you might need to find an alternative implementation or include the old version of the library as a separate dependency.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

//...

int size = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
size += new MinHeap().size();
size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
```
Explanation:

* We imported the classes that have a `size()` method in the new version of the library.
* We created instances of these classes and called their `size()` method.
* We added the sizes together and assigned the result to the `size` variable.

Note: This patch assumes that the original code was trying to compute the size of some objects. If that's not the case, this patch may not be appropriate.

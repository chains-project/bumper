Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```

This patch imports the new classes that were added in the updated library, and creates instances of each of them to calculate their sizes. The size of each instance is then added to a running total, which is returned at the end. Note that the `@Override` decorator has been removed from the method declaration, since it is not overriding any method in the new version.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

public int getNumPoints() {
  int numPoints = 0;
  numPoints += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  numPoints += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  numPoints += new MinHeap().size();
  numPoints += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return numPoints;
}
```
This patch creates a new method `getNumPoints()` that calculates the size of different data structures provided by the updated library. The method uses the `size()` method of `PointIndexMMWrapper`, `PHTreeMMP`, `MinHeap`, and `MinMaxHeap` classes. These classes and methods are marked with `++` in the provided library changes, indicating that they are new in the updated library version.

The patch removes the import statement for `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Coordinate`, as it is not used in the provided code snippet and may be causing the compilation error.

The patch also removes the `@Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Note that the patch assumes that the updated library version provides a `size()` method for the mentioned classes that returns an `int` value. If this is not the case, additional modifications may be required.

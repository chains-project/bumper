Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```

This code creates instances of the new classes that were added in the updated library and calls their `size()` method. The result of each call is added to a local `size` variable, which is then returned. This way, the code is still compatible with the updated library and should not produce any errors.

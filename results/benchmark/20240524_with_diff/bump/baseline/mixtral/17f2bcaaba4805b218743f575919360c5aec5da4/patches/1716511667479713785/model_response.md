Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
size += new MinHeap().size();
size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
```
This code imports the new classes and methods from the updated library and uses them to compute the size of four different data structures. Note that the `size()` method is now abstract in the `MinHeapI` and `MinMaxHeapI` interfaces, but it is still concrete in the `MinHeap` and `MinMaxHeap` classes. Therefore, we can still call `size()` on instances of these classes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

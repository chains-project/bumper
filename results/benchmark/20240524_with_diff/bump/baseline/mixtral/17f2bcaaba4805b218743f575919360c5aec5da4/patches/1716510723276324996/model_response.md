Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.JUnit4;

@RunWith(JUnit4.class)
public class FastPolygonizerTests {
  // existing code...
}
```
In the new version of the library, the `@Ignore` annotation has been removed and replaced with the `@org.junit.experimental.categories.Category` annotation. However, instead of trying to update the existing code to use the new annotation, we can use a workaround by wrapping the test class with a JUnit4 runner. This way, all the test methods in the class will be executed without requiring any changes to the individual methods.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int sizeOfIndexWrapper = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
int sizeOfPHTreeMMP = new PHTreeMMP().size();
int sizeOfMinHeap = new MinHeap().size();
int sizeOfMinMaxHeap = new MinMaxHeap().size();
```

This patch imports the new classes that were added in the updated library version, and creates instances of those classes to call their `size()` method.

Note that the `@Override` decorator has been removed from the method, since it is not overriding any method in the new version. Also, the `Polygon` class from the previous import statement has been removed, since it is not used in the method.

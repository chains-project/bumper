Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int sizeOfPointIndexMMWrapper = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
int sizeOfPHTreeMMP = new PHTreeMMP().size();
int sizeOfMinHeap = new MinHeap().size();
int sizeOfMinMaxHeap = new MinMaxHeap().size();
```

This patch imports the new classes that were added in the updated library version and creates instances of those classes to call their `size()` methods. Note that I had to remove the `Override` decorator from the `size()` method since it is not overriding any method in the new version.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```
This patch creates a new method `size()` that calculates the size of four different classes from the updated library. It creates a new instance of each class and calls the `size()` method on it, adding the result to a running total. This total is then returned as the result of the `size()` method.

Note that this patch may not be the most efficient solution, as it creates a new instance of each class every time the `size()` method is called. Depending on the use case, it may be more appropriate to store these instances as class variables or to use a different approach to calculate the size. However, this patch should be sufficient to fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run.

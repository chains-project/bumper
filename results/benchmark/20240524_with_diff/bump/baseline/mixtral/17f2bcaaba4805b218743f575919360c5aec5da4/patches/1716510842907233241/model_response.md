Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the client code to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.JUnit4;

@RunWith(JUnit4.class)
@Ignore
public class YourTestClass {
  // your test methods here
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the `Ignore` class cannot be found in the `org.junit` package. This may be due to a change in the JUnit library version that the client code depends on.

To fix this error, you can use the `@Ignore` annotation instead of the `Ignore` class. However, `@Ignore` is not a class, but an annotation, so you cannot import it directly. Instead, you can use the `@RunWith` annotation to specify the JUnit 4 runner, which will allow you to use JUnit 4 annotations such as `@Ignore`.

Note that the `@Ignore` annotation can be placed at the class level or the method level, depending on whether you want to ignore the entire test class or just individual test methods. In this example, I have placed it at the class level, but you can adjust the code to suit your needs.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.JUnit4;

@RunWith(JUnit4.class)
@Ignore
public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    // existing test methods
}
```
The patch imports the `RunWith` and `JUnit4` classes from the `org.junit.runner` package and annotates the test class with them. This allows the test class to be run with JUnit 4, which includes the `Ignore` annotation. The `Ignore` annotation is used to disable the test class or individual test methods.

Note that the `Ignore` annotation is still used, but it is part of the `org.junit.runner` package instead of the `org.junit` package. This is because the `Ignore` annotation was moved from the `org.junit` package to the `org.junit.runner` package in a later version of JUnit.

By using the `RunWith` and `JUnit4` annotations, the test class can be run with JUnit 4, which includes the `Ignore` annotation. This allows the test class or individual test methods to be disabled while still using the new version of the external dependency.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int sizeOfPointIndexMMWrapper = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
int sizeOfPHTreeMMP = new PHTreeMMP().size();
int sizeOfMinHeap = new MinHeap().size();
int sizeOfMinMaxHeap = new MinMaxHeap().size();
```

This code creates instances of the new classes that were added in the updated library version, and calls their `size()` method to compute their size. Note that the `size()` method is present in all the new classes, so it's safe to assume that it can be used in the client code. Also, since the method is not marked as abstract, it can be called on the instances of these classes.

By creating instances of these classes and calling their `size()` method, the client code can avoid using the removed library methods and use the new ones instead. This should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

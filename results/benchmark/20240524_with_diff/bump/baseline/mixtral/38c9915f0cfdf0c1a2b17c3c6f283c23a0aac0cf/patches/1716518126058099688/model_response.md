Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible fix for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;
import java.util.Iterator;

// ...

import static org.cactoos.text.TextOf.iterator;

// ...

public class RtTransaction {
  // ...

  private static String trimmed(String text) {
    return new TextOf(iterator(text)).asString();
  }

  // ...
}
```
In this fix, I introduced a new private method `trimmed` that takes a `String` parameter and returns a trimmed version of it. The `TextOf` class can take an `Iterator` of `CharSequence` objects and return a `Text` object, which can then be converted to a `String` using the `asString` method. The `iterator` method is a static import of the `TextOf` class, which creates an iterator from a single `CharSequence` object.

This fix uses the `TextOf` class, which is an added library method identified with `++`. The `TrimmedText` class, which was used in the original code, is no longer available in the new library version. Instead, we can use the `TextOf` class to create a `Text` object from an iterator of characters, and then use the `asString` method to convert it to a `String`.

Note that this fix assumes that the input string does not contain any null characters. If null characters are expected, the `TextOf` class may throw a `NullPointerException`. In that case, a different approach may be needed.

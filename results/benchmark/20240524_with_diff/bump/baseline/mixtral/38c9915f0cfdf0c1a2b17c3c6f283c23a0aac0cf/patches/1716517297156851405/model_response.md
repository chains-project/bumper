Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<Double> balance = new Sticky<>(() -> {
    // implementation to get the balance
});

// ...

public double getBalance(String currency) throws IOException {
    Scalar<Double> balanceInCurrency = new ScalarOf<>(() -> {
        double balanceInBase = balance.value();
        // implementation to convert balance to the requested currency
        return balanceInBase;
    });
    return balanceInCurrency.value();
}
```

In this patch, I introduced a `Scalar` to represent the wallet balance and a `Sticky` decorator to memoize the result of the lambda expression. In the `getBalance` method, I created a new `Scalar` to represent the balance in the requested currency and returned its value.

The `Scalar` and `Sticky` classes are new additions in the updated library version. The `ScalarOf` class is used to create a `Scalar` from a lambda expression.

This patch assumes that the original implementation of the `getBalance` method was using a method that has been removed in the updated library version. You might need to adjust the implementation based on the specifics of your use case.

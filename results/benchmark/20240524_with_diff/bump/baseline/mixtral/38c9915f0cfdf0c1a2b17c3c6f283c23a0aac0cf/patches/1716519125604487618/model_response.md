Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.io.Joined;
import org.cactoos.text.Text;
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;

...

Text joined = new Joined(
  new TextOf("From: %s\n", from),
  new TextOf("To: %s\n", to),
  new TextOf("Subject: %s\n", subject),
  new TextOf("\n%s\n", body)
);
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with the correct one for the new version of the library, and updates the construction of the `joined` variable to use the new `Joined` class and the `TextOf` class instead of the removed `JoinedText` and `TextOf` classes.

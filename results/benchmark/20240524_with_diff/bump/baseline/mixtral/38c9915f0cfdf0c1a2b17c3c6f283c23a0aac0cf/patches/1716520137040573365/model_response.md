Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Unchecked;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ...; // get the scalar value
Unchecked<Bytes> uncheckedBytes = new Unchecked<>(bytes);
Bytes actualBytes = uncheckedBytes.value();
```
In this patch, we first import the necessary classes, then we create a `Scalar` object to hold the bytes value. We then wrap this scalar in an `Unchecked` object, which allows us to call the `value()` method without worrying about null values. Finally, we call the `value()` method to get the actual bytes value.

Note that this patch assumes that you have a way to get the bytes value as a `Scalar` object. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public double rtScore(String url) throws IOException {
  double sum = 0.0;
  try (InputStream input = new URL(url).openStream()) {
    for (byte b : new IterableOf(new InputStreamToBytes(input))) {
      sum += new LengthOf<>(new IterableOf(b)).doubleValue();
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the `LengthOf` class from `org.cactoos.iterable` with the one from `org.cactoos.scalar`. We also changed the way we get the length of each byte from an `Iterable` to a `Scalar`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `IterableOf` and `InputStreamToBytes` classes are available in the project, and that the `URL` and `IOException` classes are from the `java.net` package. If any of these assumptions are incorrect, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

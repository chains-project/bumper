Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public double score(Exchange exchange) throws IOException {
  long sum = new LengthOf<Exchange>(exchange).value();
  // ...
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` import with `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf`. The new `LengthOf` class accepts an `Iterable` in its constructor, which is perfect for our use case. We can then call the `value()` method to get the length of the `Iterable`.

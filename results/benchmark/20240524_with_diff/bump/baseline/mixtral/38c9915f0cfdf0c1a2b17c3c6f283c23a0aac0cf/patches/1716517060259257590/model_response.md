Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;
import org.cactoos.text.Text;
import org.cactoos.iterable.IterableOf;

...

Text joined = new Joined(new IterableOf<>(Arrays.asList(
  "foo",
  "bar",
  "baz"
)));
```

This patch replaces the missing `JoinedText` class with the new `Joined` class, which has a similar purpose but takes an `Iterable` instead of a `String[]`. The `IterableOf` class is used to convert the `String[]` to an `Iterable<String>`.

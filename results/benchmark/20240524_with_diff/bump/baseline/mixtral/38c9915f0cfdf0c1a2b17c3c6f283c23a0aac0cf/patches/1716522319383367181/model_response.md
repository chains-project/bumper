Here's a possible patch for the code:
```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;
import java.io.IOException;

// ...

try (IoCheckedBytes input = new IoCheckedBytes(new BytesOf(() -> getClass()
  .getResourceAsStream("/path/to/resource")))) {
  // use input.asBytes() to get the bytes of the resource
} catch (IOException e) {
  // handle exception
}
```
This code uses the `IoCheckedBytes` class, which is a new addition in the library version you provided. It reads the contents of a resource file as bytes, and ensures that any checked exceptions thrown during the reading process are properly handled.

Note that you need to replace `/path/to/resource` with the actual path to the resource file you want to read. Also, make sure to handle the `IOException` appropriately in your code.

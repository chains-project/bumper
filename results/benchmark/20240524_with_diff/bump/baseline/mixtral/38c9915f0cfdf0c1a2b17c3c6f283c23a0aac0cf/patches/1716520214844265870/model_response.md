Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;

// ...

public RtTransaction(RtTransactions transactions, RtTransaction prev, RtTransaction next, RtAccount account, RtBlock block, RtValue value, RtCredit credit, RtDebit debit, RtFee fee, RtTimestamp timestamp, RtHash hash, RtSign sign, RtNonce nonce) {
  super(
    new TextOf(
      transactions.toString() + " " +
      (prev != null ? prev.id() : "") + " " +
      (next != null ? next.id() : "") + " " +
      account.toString() + " " +
      block.toString() + " " +
      value.toString() + " " +
      credit.toString() + " " +
      debit.toString() + " " +
      fee.toString() + " " +
      timestamp.toString() + " " +
      hash.toString() + " " +
      sign.toString() + " " +
      nonce.toString()
    )
  );
  // ...
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the usage of `TrimmedText` with `TextOf`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. `TextOf` is a simple wrapper around a `CharSequence`, and it has a constructor that takes a `CharSequence` as an argument. I used the `toString()` method of each argument to convert them to strings, and then concatenated them using the `+` operator. This should produce the same result as the original code, but without using the removed `TrimmedText` class.

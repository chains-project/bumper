Here's the fixed version of the method:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ...;
Scalar<Integer> size = new ScalarEnvelope<>(() -> bytes.asBytes().length);
```
In this version, we replaced the usage of `UncheckedScalar` with `ScalarEnvelope`, which is an added method in the new library version. The `ScalarEnvelope` class allows us to create a scalar that wraps another scalar or a function that returns the value of the scalar. Here, we used it to wrap a function that returns the length of the byte array returned by the `bytes` scalar.

Note that we also changed the type of the `size` variable to `Scalar<Integer>` to reflect the fact that it now returns an integer value.

This version should compile and run successfully with the new version of the library.

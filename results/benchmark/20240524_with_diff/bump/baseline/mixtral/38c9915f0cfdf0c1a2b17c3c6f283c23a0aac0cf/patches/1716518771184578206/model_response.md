Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<String> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> "some value");
String value = scalar.value();
```

This code creates a `Sticky` scalar that always returns the same value, which is obtained by calling the `value()` method. Note that `StickyScalar` has been removed in the new library version, but `Sticky` can still be used to achieve the same functionality.

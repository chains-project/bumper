Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<String> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> "value");
```

In this patch, we're importing the `Scalar` interface from the `cactoos` library, which is still present in the new version. We then create a new `Sticky` object that wraps a `Scalar` implementation. The `Sticky` class is also still present in the new version, and it takes a `Callable` object as its constructor argument.

The `Callable` object we're passing to the `Sticky` constructor is a lambda expression that returns a string value. We could replace this lambda expression with any other implementation of `Callable` that returns the desired value.

Note that the `StickyScalar` class has been removed in the new version, so we can't use it directly. However, we can still create a `Sticky` object that behaves similarly to a `StickyScalar` by using the `Sticky` constructor that takes a `Callable` object as its argument.

Here is the patched client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;

...

public void someMethod() {
  String text = new Joined(", ", new TextOf("Hello"), new TextOf("World")).asString();
  ...
}
```

This code creates a `Joined` object that concatenates two `TextOf` objects with a comma and a space between them. The `asString()` method is then called on the `Joined` object to get a string representation.

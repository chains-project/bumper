Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ... ; // get the scalar value
UncheckedBytes uncheckedBytes = new ScalarEnvelope<>(bytes);
```
Explanation:
- We can no longer use the `UncheckedScalar` class directly, as it has been removed in the new library version.
- However, we can still use the `Scalar` interface, which is still present in the new version.
- To convert a `Scalar` to an `UncheckedBytes`, we can use the `ScalarEnvelope` class, which is a new addition in the new library version.
- We can then use the `UncheckedBytes` class, which is also a new addition in the new library version.
- Note that we're assuming that the original scalar value is of type `Bytes`, but you may need to adjust this depending on the actual type of the scalar value.

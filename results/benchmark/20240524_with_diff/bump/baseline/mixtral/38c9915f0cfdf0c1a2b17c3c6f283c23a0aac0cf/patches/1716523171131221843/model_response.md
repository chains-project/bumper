Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.CheckedBytes;
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;

// ...

public class Wallet {
    // ...

    private CheckedBytes bytes(final Bytes source) {
        return new IoCheckedBytes(source);
    }

    // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `CheckedScalar` with `CheckedBytes`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. The `bytes` method takes a `Bytes` object and returns a `CheckedBytes` object, which can be used to wrap any byte-based computation that might throw an exception.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the issue depending on the specific use case and requirements.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ... ; // get the scalar of bytes
IoCheckedBytes ioCheckedBytes = new IoCheckedBytes(bytes);
InputStream inputStream = ioCheckedBytes.asBytes();
```
This code creates a `Scalar` of bytes, then converts it to an `IoCheckedBytes` using the new `IoCheckedBytes` constructor, and then gets the bytes as an `InputStream`. The `UncheckedScalar` class is not used anymore, as it was removed in the new version of the library. The `IoCheckedScalar` class was also removed, so it cannot be used either. Instead, the `IoCheckedBytes` class should be used, which provides a similar functionality.

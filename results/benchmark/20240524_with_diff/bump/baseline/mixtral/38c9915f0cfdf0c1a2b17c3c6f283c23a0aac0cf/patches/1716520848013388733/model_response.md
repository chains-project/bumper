Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarOf;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new ScalarOf<>(() -> 42);
// Use 'scalar' instead of 'SolidScalar'
```

The patch creates a `Scalar` instance using the `ScalarOf` class, which is an added method in the new library version. The `Scalar` instance can be used in place of the removed `SolidScalar` class. In this example, I initialized the scalar with a simple function that returns an integer value of 42, but you can replace it with the appropriate logic for your use case.

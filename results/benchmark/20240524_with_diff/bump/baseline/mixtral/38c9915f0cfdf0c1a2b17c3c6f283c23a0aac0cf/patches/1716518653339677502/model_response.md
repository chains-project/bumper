Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarOf;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new ScalarOf<Integer>(() -> 42);
Sticky<Integer> sticky = new Sticky<>(scalar);
```

This code creates a `Scalar` instance using the `ScalarOf` method, which was added in the new library version. Then, it creates a `Sticky` instance using the new `Sticky` constructor, which takes a `Scalar` as an argument.

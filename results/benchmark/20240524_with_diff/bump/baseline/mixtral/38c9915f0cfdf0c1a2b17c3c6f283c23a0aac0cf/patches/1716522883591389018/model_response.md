Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered;

// ...

public Iterable<String> addresses() throws IOException {
  return new Filtered<String>(
    new Predicate<String>() {
      @Override
      public boolean check(String item) throws IOException {
        return !item.isEmpty();
      }
    },
    this.list()
  );
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `Filtered` class cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.collection` package. However, the `Filtered` class is still available in the `org.cactoos.iterable` package, so we can import it from there instead.
The `Filtered` class now expects an `Iterable` and a `Func` as arguments, so we need to adjust the code accordingly. We can create a `Predicate` object that implements the `Func` interface, and pass it to the `Filtered` constructor along with the `list()` method's result. The `Predicate` object's `check` method will be called for each item in the list, and it will return `true` if the item is not empty.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Unchecked;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ...;
// ...
Bytes content = new Unchecked<>(bytes).value();
```

This patch replaces the usage of `UncheckedScalar` with `Unchecked`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. The `Unchecked` class can be used to unwrap a `Scalar` and obtain its value, similar to how `UncheckedScalar` was used before.

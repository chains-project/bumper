Here's the patched version of the client code that uses the new `Sticky` method added in the updated library version:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;
import org.cactoos.Input;

public class RtTransaction {
    // ...
    private Sticky<Input> input = Sticky.with(this::inputSupplier);

    private Input inputSupplier() {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

The `StickyScalar` class has been removed in the updated library version, so we replace its usage with the new `Sticky` method that takes a `Supplier` of the required type and returns a `Sticky` object. We can then use the `Sticky` object to get the value of the scalar.

Note that the `Sticky` method was added in the updated library version, so we can use it in the patched client code.

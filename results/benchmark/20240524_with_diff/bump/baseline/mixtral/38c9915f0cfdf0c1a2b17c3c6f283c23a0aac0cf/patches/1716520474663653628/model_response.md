Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public long length(Iterable<Transaction> transactions) {
  return new LengthOf<Transaction>(transactions).longValue();
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `LengthOf` class cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.iterable` package. Upon checking the library changes, we can see that the `LengthOf` class has been moved to the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. Therefore, we need to import the `LengthOf` class from the new package.
The method signature remains unchanged, so we only need to replace the `LengthOf` class import and update the method implementation to use the new `LengthOf` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. We can do this by creating a new `LengthOf` instance with the `transactions` parameter and calling the `longValue()` method to get the length of the iterable.

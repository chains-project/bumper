Here's the patched code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;
import org.cactoos.text.Text;

public class WalletsIn {
    // ...

    private Text joined(Iterable<Text> parts) {
        return new Joined(parts);
    }

    // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of the removed `JoinedText` class with the new `Joined` class. The `Joined` class can be found in the `org.cactoos.io` package, which was added in the new library version.

The `joined` method is a new method that takes an `Iterable<Text>` as a parameter and returns a `Text` object. The `Joined` class is used to join multiple `Text` objects into a single `Text` object.

The `joined` method can be used in the `WalletsIn` class to replace the usage of `JoinedText`.

Note that the `JoinedText` class was removed in the new library version, so it's not possible to use it in the `WalletsIn` class. The `Joined` class is a suitable replacement for `JoinedText`, as it provides similar functionality.

The `Joined` class can be used in the same way as `JoinedText`, so the `WalletsIn` class can be modified to use `Joined` without any major changes.

The `Joined` class is a generic class that can be used with any type of `Text` object, so it can be used with any type of text data.

The `Joined` class is a more flexible and powerful replacement for `JoinedText`, as it can be used with any type of `Text` object. The `Joined` class can be used to join multiple `Text` objects into a single `Text` object, which can be used in any context where a single `Text` object is required.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ...; // initialize Scalar<Bytes>
UncheckedBytes uncheckedBytes = new ScalarEnvelope<>(bytes);
```
This patch replaces the usage of `UncheckedScalar` with `ScalarEnvelope`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. The `ScalarEnvelope` class wraps a `Scalar` and ensures that its value is not `null`. The `UncheckedBytes` class can be constructed with a `Scalar<Bytes>` and provides an `asBytes()` method that returns the bytes as a byte array.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new ScalarEnvelope<>(() -> 42);
```

This patch replaces the usage of `UncheckedScalar` with `ScalarEnvelope`, which is a new class in the updated library version. The `ScalarEnvelope` class wraps a `Scalar` and ensures that its `value()` method does not return `null`. In this patch, we create a `Scalar` that always returns the integer value `42`. You can replace the integer value with your desired logic.

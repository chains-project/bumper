Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered;

// ...

@Override
public InputStream balanceStream() throws IOException {
  return new Filtered<>(
    inputs -> Iterables.size(inputs) > 0,
    this::balanceStreams
  ).stream();
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the usage of `org.cactoos.collection.Filtered` with `org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered`, which is the new class that replaced the old one. The method signatures are compatible, so no other changes were needed.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

//...

public double rtScore(String url) throws IOException {
    //...
    int length = new LengthOf<Iterable<Token>>(tokens).intValue();
    //...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the failing import statement with the new equivalent in the updated library. We also replace the `LengthOf` class with the new `LengthOf` class in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package.

Note that the new `LengthOf` class takes an `Iterable` parameter and returns a `Scalar`, which can be converted to an `int` value using the `intValue()` method.

This patch assumes that the `tokens` variable is an `Iterable<Token>`. If it's not, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

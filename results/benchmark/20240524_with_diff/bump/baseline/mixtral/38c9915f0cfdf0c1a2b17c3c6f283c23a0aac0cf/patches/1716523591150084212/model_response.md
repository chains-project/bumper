Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.BytesOf;
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;

// ...

@Override
public Text remoteText() throws IOException {
    try (InputStream input = new URL(this.url()).openStream()) {
        return new TextOf(new BytesOf(input));
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the use of the removed `RandomText` class with a combination of `BytesOf` and `TextOf` classes, which are added in the new library version. The `BytesOf` class is used to read the content of the URL as bytes, and then the `TextOf` class is used to convert the bytes to a `Text` object.

Note that this patch assumes that the content of the URL can be read as bytes and converted to a `Text` object. If the content is not in a text format, further processing may be needed.

Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public class TaxBeneficiaries {
    // ...

    @Override
    public int tax(final Beneficiary beneficiary) {
        final Iterable<Transaction> transactions = transactionsOf(beneficiary);
        return new LengthOf(transactions).intValue();
    }

    // ...
}
```
In this patch, I changed the import statement to use `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` instead of `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf`. This is because the `org.cactoos.iterable.LengthOf` class has been removed in the new library version.

Instead, I used the new `org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf` class, which takes an `Iterable` as its constructor argument. This allows us to calculate the length of the `transactions` iterable and return it as an integer.

Note that I also changed the method call from `new LengthOf<Transaction>(transactions).intValue()` to `new LengthOf(transactions).intValue()`. This is because the generic type parameter is no longer necessary, since `LengthOf` now has a constructor that takes an `Iterable` as its argument.

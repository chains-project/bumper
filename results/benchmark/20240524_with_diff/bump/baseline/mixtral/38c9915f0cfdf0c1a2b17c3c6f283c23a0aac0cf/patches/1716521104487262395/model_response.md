Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;

//...

IoCheckedScalar<String> scalar = new IoCheckedScalar<>(() -> "Hello, world!");
IoCheckedBytes<String> bytes = new IoCheckedBytes<>(scalar::value);
```
Explanation:
The original code was using `IoCheckedScalar` class from `org.cactoos.scalar` package, which has been removed in the new library version.
To fix the error, we need to find an alternative class that provides similar functionality.
In this case, we can use `IoCheckedBytes` class from the same package, which can take a `Scalar` as a parameter and return a checked bytes.
We can then create a `Scalar` instance using a lambda expression that returns a string value.
This way, we can achieve the same functionality as the original code while using the new library version.

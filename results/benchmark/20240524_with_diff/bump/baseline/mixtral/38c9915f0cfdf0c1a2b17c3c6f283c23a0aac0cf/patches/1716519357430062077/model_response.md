Here is the fixed version of the code that replaces the failing import statement:

```java
import org.cactoos.io.Joined;
```

And here is the fixed version of the code that keeps the import statement unchanged:

```java
public class WalletsIn extends Wallets {
    public WalletsIn(final Repo repo) {
        super(new Joined<Text>(
            "Wallets:\n",
            new IoCheckedText(new TextOf(
                repo.list().stream()
                    .filter(WALLET_PATTERN::matcher)
                    .map(Path::getFileName)
                    .map(Path::toString)
                    .collect(Collectors.joining("\n"))
            )),
            "\n"
        ));
    }
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `JoinedText` class has been removed and replaced with the `Joined` class in the `org.cactoos.io` package. The `JoinedText` class was used to join text elements with a delimiter, while the `Joined` class is more generic and can join any type of `Input` elements, including text.

In the fixed version of the code, we use the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.io` package instead of the `JoinedText` class. We also replace the `TextOf` class with the `IoCheckedText` class, which is a subclass of `TextOf` that can handle exceptions.

Note that the `JoinedText` class is still available in the new version of the library as a deprecated class, but it is recommended to use the `Joined` class instead.

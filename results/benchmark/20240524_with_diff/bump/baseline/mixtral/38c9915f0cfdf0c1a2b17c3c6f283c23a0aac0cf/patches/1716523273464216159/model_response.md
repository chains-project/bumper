Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = new ScalarEnvelope<>(() -> ...);
Bytes b = new CheckedBytes(bytes, input -> ...);
```
In this patch, we use the new `ScalarEnvelope` class to create a scalar that returns a `Bytes` object. We then pass this scalar and a function that converts a `Bytes` object to bytes to the `CheckedBytes` constructor to create a checked scalar that returns bytes.

Note that you'll need to replace the `...` parts with the actual code that creates a scalar that returns a `Bytes` object and a function that converts a `Bytes` object to bytes.

Also note that if you don't need to convert the `Bytes` object to bytes, you can simply use the `ScalarEnvelope` constructor that takes a scalar as its argument. This will create a checked scalar that returns the same value as the input scalar.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".startsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The patch changes the `StringStartsWith` constructor call to pass the correct number of arguments. It does this by introducing a separate variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value, and passing this variable as the first argument to `StringStartsWith`. This allows the second argument to be passed as `"/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"` as required by the `StringStartsWith` constructor.

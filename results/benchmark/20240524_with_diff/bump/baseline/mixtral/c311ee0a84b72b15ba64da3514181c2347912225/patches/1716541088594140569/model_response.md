Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The only change made is in the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` line. The `StringContains` constructor now takes only one argument, a `String` containing the expected substring. This is because the `StringContains` constructor that takes a `boolean` and a `String` has been removed in the new library version.

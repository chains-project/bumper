Here's the fixed `UnPackThemeMojo.java` method that resolves the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.resolver.ArtifactResolutionException;

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
    try {
        // ... (existing code)
    } catch (ArtifactResolutionException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to unpack theme.", e);
    }
}
```

The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been replaced with `ArtifactResolutionException`, which is the new class that should be used for the given scenario.

Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(new StringStartsWith.StringStartsWithBuilder()
                .prefix("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
                .build())
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, the `StringStartsWith` constructor's arguments have been changed to use the `StringStartsWith.StringStartsWithBuilder` instead of a boolean and a string. This allows the code to be compatible with the new version of the library. Additionally, a variable `startsWith` has been declared and set to `false`, but it is not used in this patch. This is to demonstrate that variables can be added to make the code easier to understand.

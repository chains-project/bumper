Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionWhenDigestIsAbsent() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        Assertions.assertThrows(
            IllegalStateException.class,
            () -> new UploadEntity.Request(
                new RequestLine(
                    RqMethod.PUT,
                    "/v2/my-repo/blobs/uploads/123-abc?what=nothing"
                ).toString()
            ).digest()
        ).getMessage(),
        new StringStartsWith("Unexpected query") // replace 'StringContains' with 'StringStartsWith'
    );
}
```
The only change I made is to replace the `StringContains` matcher with `StringStartsWith`, since the former has been removed in the new library version. The `StringStartsWith` matcher checks if a string starts with a given substring, which seems to be sufficient for the test case.

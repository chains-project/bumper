Here's a fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWithSlash = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".startsWith("/");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWithSlash, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The change I made is to extract the boolean value `startsWithSlash` from the `StringStartsWith` constructor call, and pass it as a separate argument. This resolves the error by providing the correct number of arguments to the constructor.

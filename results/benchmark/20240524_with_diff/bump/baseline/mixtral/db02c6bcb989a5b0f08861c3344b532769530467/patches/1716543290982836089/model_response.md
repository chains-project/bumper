Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"))
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new boolean variable `startsWith` and set it to `false`. Then, I passed this variable as an argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor, which now only takes a single argument. This should fix the error message you were seeing.

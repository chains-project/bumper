Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In this patch, I changed the `StringContains` constructor to only take a single argument, which is the expected substring. This is because the `StringContains` constructor that takes two arguments has been removed in the new library version.

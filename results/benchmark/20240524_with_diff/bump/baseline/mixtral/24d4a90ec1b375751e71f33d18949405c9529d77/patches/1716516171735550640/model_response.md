Here's the fixed version of the code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed. However, the `Loggable` aspect can be used to achieve similar functionality. The `Loggable` aspect logs method calls, making it a suitable replacement for the removed `Tv` class. In this case, I've set the logging level to DEBUG. You can adjust the logging level as needed.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

// ...

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the import of `Tv` with `Loggable` from the same package `com.jcabi.aspects`. I also added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `BucketRule` class. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error for `Tv`.

Note that I cannot guarantee that this patch will not introduce new issues as I don't have the full context of the codebase and the expected behavior of the `BucketRule` class. However, this should resolve the compilation error you're facing.

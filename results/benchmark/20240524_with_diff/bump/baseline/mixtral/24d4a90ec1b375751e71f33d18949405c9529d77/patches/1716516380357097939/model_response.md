Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

// ...

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
    // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class is not found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

To fix the error, we can find an alternative class or method in the new library version that provides similar functionality. In this case, the `Loggable` aspect seems to be a good alternative. It can be used to log debug messages, similar to what the `Tv` aspect was used for.

We can replace the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect by importing the `Loggable` class and adding the `@Loggable` annotation to the class. We can also set the log level to `DEBUG` to ensure that debug messages are logged.

Note that this patch assumes that the `BucketRule` class was not overriding any methods that used the `Tv` aspect. If it was, we may need to modify the overriding methods to use the `Loggable` aspect instead.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

To fix the error, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using the removed class.

In this case, we can use the `Loggable` aspect from the same package to achieve similar logging functionality. By annotating the class with `@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)`, we can log debug messages for all methods in the class.

Note: I had to make a guess about the intended functionality of the `Tv` class, as it is not included in the provided code snippet. If the `Tv` class had a different purpose, a different solution may be necessary.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class MyClass {
  // existing code...

  // replace the failing import statement with the following line:
  import static com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable.Value;

  // existing code...
}
```
In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced with the `Immutable` aspect. To fix the error, you can replace the failing import statement with an import statement for the `Immutable` aspect, and then use the `Value` method from the `Immutable` aspect instead of the `Tv` class.

Note that the `Immutable` aspect is annotated with the `@Immutable` annotation, which indicates that instances of the aspect are immutable. I have added this annotation to the `MyClass` class to ensure that it is compatible with the `Immutable` aspect.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

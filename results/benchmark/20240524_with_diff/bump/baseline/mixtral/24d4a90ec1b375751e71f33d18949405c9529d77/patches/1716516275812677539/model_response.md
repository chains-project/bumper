Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The `Tv` class was removed from the library, so we can't use it anymore. However, the `Loggable` aspect was added and it provides similar functionality. We can use it instead of `Tv` to log debug messages.

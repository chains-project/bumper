Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced with the `Loggable` aspect. You can use the `@Loggable` annotation instead of the `Tv` class to achieve similar functionality. In this example, I replaced the `Tv` import with the `Loggable` import and added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class with the DEBUG level. You can adjust the level according to your needs.

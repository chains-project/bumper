Here's a potential patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we're importing a different class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, namely `Loggable`. This class provides similar functionality to the `Tv` class, in that it can be used to add logging to a method.

Note that we're also adding a `@Loggable` annotation to the `AwsOcketITCase` class, which will enable logging for all methods in the class. You can adjust the logging level by changing the argument to the `@Loggable` annotation.

This patch should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error for the `Tv` class, since we're no longer using that class. Instead, we're using the `Loggable` class, which is available in the updated library version.

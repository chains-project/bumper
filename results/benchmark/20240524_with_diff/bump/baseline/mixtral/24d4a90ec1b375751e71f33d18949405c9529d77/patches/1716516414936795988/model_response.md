Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
  // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `com.jcabi.aspects` library has been updated, and the `Tv` class is no longer available.

To fix the error, we need to find an alternative way to accomplish the same task without using the `Tv` class. One possible solution is to use the `Loggable` aspect instead. The `Loggable` aspect can be used to log debug messages, which is similar to what the `Tv` aspect does.

To use the `Loggable` aspect, we need to import the `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable` class and apply the `@Loggable` annotation to the class. The `@Loggable` annotation takes a log level as a parameter. In this case, we use the `Loggable.DEBUG` constant to log debug messages.

By using the `Loggable` aspect instead of the `Tv` aspect, we can avoid the compilation error and achieve the same functionality.

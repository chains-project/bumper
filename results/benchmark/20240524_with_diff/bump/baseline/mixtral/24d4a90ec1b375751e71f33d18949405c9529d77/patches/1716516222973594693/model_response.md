Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```

The `Tv` class was removed, but you can use the `Loggable` aspect instead. The `@Loggable` annotation can be added to the class to enable logging for all methods. In this case, I set the log level to DEBUG. Adjust the log level as needed.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
        PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
        textEncryptor.setPasswordEncryptor(passwordEncryptor);
        return new PasswordEncoder() {
            @Override
            public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
                return textEncryptor.encrypt(rawPassword.toString());
            }

            @Override
            public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
                return textEncryptor.decrypt(encodedPassword).equals(rawPassword.toString());
            }
        };
    }
}
```

This patch creates a new `SecurityConfig` class that provides a `passwordEncoder` bean. The `PasswordEncoder` is implemented as an anonymous class that uses a `TextEncryptor` and a `PasswordEncryptor` to encode and validate passwords.

Note that the `PasswordEncoder` interface has changed in the new library version, so the `isPasswordValid` method is no longer available. Instead, the `matches` method is used to validate passwords.

Also note that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been removed in the new library version, so it cannot be used. Instead, the `PasswordEncryptor` class is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords.

Finally, note that the `TextEncryptor` class is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords, as it provides a simpler interface than the `PBEStringEncryptor` class.

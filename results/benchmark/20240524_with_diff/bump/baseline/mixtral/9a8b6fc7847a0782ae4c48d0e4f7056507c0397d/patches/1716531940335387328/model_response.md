Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the fully qualified name of `PasswordEncoder` and `StrongPasswordEncryptor` with the new fully qualified names that match the new library version. This ensures that the code uses the correct classes from the updated library.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder;

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    PasswordEncryptor encryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder(encryptor);
    return passwordEncoder;
}
```

This patch uses the new `PasswordEncryptor` class from the updated library, and wraps it in a `StandardPasswordEncoder` to maintain the same interface as before. Note that the `PasswordEncoder` interface has been moved from `org.jasypt.spring.security` to `org.springframework.security.crypto.password`, so the import statement has changed accordingly.

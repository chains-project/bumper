Here's the proposed patch for the failing method in the client code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

// ...

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPasswordEncryptor(passwordEncryptor);

    Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder encoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setEncryptor(passwordEncryptor);
    return encoder;
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of the removed `PBEPasswordEncoder` with the new `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder`. Additionally, it creates a `PasswordEncryptor` instance to set as the password encryptor for both `PasswordEncoder` and `TextEncryptor`.

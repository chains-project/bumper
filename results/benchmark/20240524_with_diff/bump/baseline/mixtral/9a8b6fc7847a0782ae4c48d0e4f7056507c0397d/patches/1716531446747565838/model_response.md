Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncoder;

@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    private final TextEncryptor textEncryptor;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        ConfigurablePasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new ConfigurablePasswordEncoder();
        passwordEncoder.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
        passwordEncoder.setKeyObtentionIterations(1000);
        passwordEncoder.setPoolSize(1);
        passwordEncoder.setProviderName("SunJCE");
        passwordEncoder.setSaltGenerator(new RandomSaltGenerator());
        passwordEncoder.setStringOutputType("base64");
        textEncryptor.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncoder);
    }

    @Override
    public String encodePassword(String rawPass, Object salt) {
        return textEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPass);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isPasswordValid(String encPass, String rawPass, Object salt) {
        return textEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encPass);
    }
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the usage of `PBEPasswordEncoder` with `ConfigurablePasswordEncoder` from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package. This new class provides similar functionality to the removed `PBEPasswordEncoder` class. I also updated the method calls to match the new method signatures.

Please note that the `textEncryptor` object is created and configured in a different way than in the original code. This is because the `PBEStringEncryptor` and `TextEncryptor` classes have been removed in the new library version. Instead, I created a `ConfigurablePasswordEncoder` object and set its properties accordingly. The `textEncryptor` object is then configured with this password encoder.

This patch should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run with the new library version.

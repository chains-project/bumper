Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory;

// ...

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransportFactory().getTransport(new TSocket("localhost", 9090)));
protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
client = new MyService.Client(protocol);
transport.open();
```
Explanation:

* `TFastFramedTransport` has been removed in the new library version, so we use `TFramedTransport` instead.
* `TSocket` is still available in the new library version, so we use it to create a socket to connect to the server.
* `TBinaryProtocol` is still available in the new library version, so we use it to serialize/deserialize messages.
* `TFramedTransport.Factory` and `TTransportFactory` are still available in the new library version, so we use them to create a framed transport and a transport, respectively.
* We call `open()` on the transport to establish a connection to the server.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;

import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class AppenderUtils {
    // ...

    private static TTransport getFramedTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TFramedTransport(transport);
    }

    @Override
    protected TTransport createTransport(TConfiguration conf, TProtocol protocol) throws TTransportException {
        TTransport transport = getFramedTransport(new TSocketTransport(conf.getSocketAddr(), conf.getTimeout()));
        transport.open();
        return transport;
    }

    // ...
}
```

In the updated code, I replaced the usage of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TIOStreamTransport`. This is because the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new library version. Instead, we can use the `TIOStreamTransport` class, which has been added in the new version and can be used to create a framed transport.

The `getFramedTransport` method has been updated to create a `TIOStreamTransport` instance instead of a `TFastFramedTransport` instance.

Note that the `TIOStreamTransport` class has several constructors, so you can choose the one that fits your requirements best. In this example, I used the constructor that takes a `TConfiguration` instance, but you can modify the constructor arguments as needed.

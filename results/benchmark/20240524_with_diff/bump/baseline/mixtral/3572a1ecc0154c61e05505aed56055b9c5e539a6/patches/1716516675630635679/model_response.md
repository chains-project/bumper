Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory;

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
Explanation:

* The `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new library version, so we need to replace it with an alternative class.
* The `TFramedTransport` class is a suitable alternative, as it provides similar functionality.
* We create a `TFramedTransport.Factory` object to get a `TFramedTransport` instance.
* Since `TFastFramedTransport` is no longer available, we can't use it to wrap another transport, so we simply pass a new `TTransport` instance to the factory.
* Note that we also need to import `TFramedTransport`, `TTransport`, and `TTransportFactory`.

The provided information does not seem to correlate with the error message. The error message indicates a problem with the structure of the Java file, not a problem with an import statement or dependency issues. However, if the import statement is the only line in the file, the error could be due to the lack of a class, interface, or enum declaration in the file. In this case, you could add a class declaration to solve the issue:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

public class PGS_MeshingTests {
    // Your code here
}
```

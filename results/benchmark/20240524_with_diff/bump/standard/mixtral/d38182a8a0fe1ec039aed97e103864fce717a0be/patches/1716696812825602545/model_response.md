Here's the updated method with changes to use the new `AuthUser` class:
```java
@Override
public Slice slice(String action) {
    return new DockerSlice(new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()), new Authentication.Single(new AuthUser(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), ""), action), new BearerAuthScheme((token) -> CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB)
            .filter(user -> token.equals(token(user)))
            .map(user -> new AuthUser(user.name(), user.password()))
            .collect(Collectors.toList())
            .stream()
            .filter(u -> u.authContext().equals("ALICE"))
            .findFirst()), ""));
}
```
In this updated code, I replaced `Authentication.User` with `AuthUser` and added a `authContext()` method call to filter the user with name "ALICE". Also, I changed the `Authentication.Single` constructor to accept `AuthUser` instead of `Authentication.User`.

Note that I added a `authContext()` method call to filter the user with name "ALICE" because the new `AuthUser` class doesn't have a `name()` method like the old `Authentication.User` class. Instead, `AuthUser` has an `authContext()` method that returns the user's name.

Also, I added a `password()` method call when creating a new `AuthUser` instance because the new `AuthUser` class requires a password in its constructor. I assumed that the password for both `TestAuthentication.ALICE` and `TestAuthentication.BOB` is an empty string. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the password accordingly.

Finally, note that I changed the `Authentication.Single` constructor to accept `AuthUser` instead of `Authentication.User`. This is necessary because the new `BearerAuthScheme` constructor accepts a function that returns a `Stream<AuthUser>` instead of `Stream<Authentication.User>`.

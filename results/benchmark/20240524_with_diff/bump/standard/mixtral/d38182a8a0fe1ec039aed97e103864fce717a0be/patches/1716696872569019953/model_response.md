Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Override
public Slice slice(String action) {
    return new DockerSlice(new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()), new Authentication.Single(new AuthUser(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), ""), action), new BearerAuthScheme((token) -> CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB).filter((user) -> token.equals(token(user))).map((user) -> new AuthUser(user.name())).findFirst()), ""));
}
```
The main change here is the use of `AuthUser` instead of `Authentication.User`, which was removed in the new library version. I also imported the fully qualified names of the classes to avoid any potential naming conflicts.

Note that I couldn't test this code, so there might be some syntax errors or other issues. However, it should give you a good starting point for fixing the error.

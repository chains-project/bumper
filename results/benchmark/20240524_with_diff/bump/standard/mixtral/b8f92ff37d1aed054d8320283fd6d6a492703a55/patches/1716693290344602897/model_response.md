Here's the patched method with the required changes to fix the error:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard() {
        // Add the missing import statement
        import org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.booterclient.lazytestprovider.Commandline;
    };
}
```

The error is caused by the missing import statement for the `Commandline` class. I've added the required import statement to fix the issue. However, this might not be enough to completely resolve the error, as there might be other changes needed depending on how the `TestListResolver.Wildcard` class is used in the rest of the code.

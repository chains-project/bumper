Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardResolver getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardResolver() {};
}
```

The change made is to replace `TestListResolver.Wildcard` with `TestListResolver.WildcardResolver`, which is the new name of the class in the updated library version.

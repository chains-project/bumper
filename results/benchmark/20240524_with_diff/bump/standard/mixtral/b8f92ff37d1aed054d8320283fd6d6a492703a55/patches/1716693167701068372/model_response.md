Here's the patched method:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardSupplier getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardSupplier() {};
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `Wildcard` class has been replaced with the `WildcardSupplier` functional interface. This change allows you to create a lambda expression or an anonymous inner class that implements the `WildcardSupplier` interface. In this case, I chose to use an anonymous inner class for better compatibility with the original code.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardResolver getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardResolver() {};
}
```

The change made is to use `WildcardResolver` instead of `Wildcard` since the error message suggests that `Wildcard` cannot be found in the `TestListResolver` class. This new class is likely added in the new library version, and it is a subclass of `Wildcard`.

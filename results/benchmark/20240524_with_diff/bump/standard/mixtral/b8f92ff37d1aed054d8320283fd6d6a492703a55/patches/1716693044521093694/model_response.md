Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.booterclient.lazytestprovider.Wildcard() {};
}
```

This patch uses the new `Wildcard` class that was added to the `lazytestprovider` package in the updated library. It is a protected inner class of `DefaultForkConfiguration`, but it is accessible from the client code because it is declared as public.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Wildcard` class has the same functionality and behavior as the original `Wildcard` class that was present in the `TestListResolver` class. If this is not the case, then the patch may not work correctly or may cause other issues.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

Here's the updated method with the necessary changes to fix the error:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard() {
        // Add this inner class to fix the "cannot find symbol" error
        private static class Wildcard {}
    };
}
```

This patch creates a nested static class `Wildcard` inside the anonymous class, which should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error. However, please note that this might not be the best solution for your specific use case. It is a workaround for the compilation error caused by the missing `Wildcard` class. It would be better to investigate why the `Wildcard` class is not found and fix the root cause if possible.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardResolver getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardResolver() {};
}
```

The failure is caused by the removal of the `Wildcard` class in the new library version. Instead, we can use the `WildcardResolver` class, which is a functional interface that provides a similar functionality. By creating an anonymous implementation of this interface, we can achieve the same behavior as before.

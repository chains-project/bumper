Here's the fixed method using the new library version:

```java
private org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getTestListResolverWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard() {};
}
```

The issue is not directly related to the given method. It seems the error is caused by a missing symbol (Wildcard) in the import statement or the classpath.

To fix the issue, ensure that the following import statement is present at the beginning of the file:

```java
import org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver;
```

If the issue still persists, double-check the classpath configuration to ensure that the new library version is correctly referenced.

Here's the patched method with the error fixed:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Repos;
import com.jcabi.github.RepoCreate;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;
import java.io.IOException;

public com.jcabi.github.Repo randomRepo() throws java.io.IOException {
    final int twenty = 20;
    return this.repos().create(new com.jcabi.github.Repos.RepoCreate(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(twenty), true));
}
```
In this patched method, I replaced the `Tv.TWENTY` constant with an integer literal `20`. The error was caused by the missing `Tv` class, which seems to have been removed in the new library version. By using the integer literal, the code will now work with the new library version.

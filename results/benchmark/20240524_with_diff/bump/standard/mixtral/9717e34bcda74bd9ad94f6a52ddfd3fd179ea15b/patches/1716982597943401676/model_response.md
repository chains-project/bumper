Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static com.jcabi.github.Tv.*;

/**
 * Create repo with random name.
 *
 * @return Repo
 * @throws IOException
 * 		If fails
 */
public com.jcabi.github.Repo randomRepo() throws java.io.IOException {
    return this.repos().create(new com.jcabi.github.Repos.RepoCreate(org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(TWENTY), true));
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found, which suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the new library version. However, the constant `TWENTY` from the `Tv` class is still being used in the client code.

To fix this issue, I have added the following import statement at the beginning of the code:

`import static com.jcabi.github.Tv.*;`

This import statement makes the constants from the `Tv` class available in the code, so that the constant `TWENTY` can be used without causing any errors.

Note that I did not modify the function signature or create any new variables. I only added an import statement to make the necessary constants available in the code.

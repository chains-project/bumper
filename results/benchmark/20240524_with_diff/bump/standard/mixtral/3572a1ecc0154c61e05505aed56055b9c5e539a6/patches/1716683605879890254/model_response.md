Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
// TODO: review this AI generated patch!
@java.lang.Override
protected org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer initialValue() {
    org.apache.org.IOStreamTransport transport;
    try {
        transport = new org.apache.org.IOStreamTransport(new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]));
    } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
        throw new org.apache.org.TTransportException(e);
   
    }
    return new org.apache.org.TDeserializer(new org.apache.org.TBinaryProtocol.Factory(), transport);
}
```
I have changed the package name of `TIOStreamTransport` and `TTransportException` from `org.apache.thrift` to `org.apache.org` because these classes have been removed in the new version of the library.

I cannot be sure that this patch will work for you, because it is possible that the removed classes were used in other parts of your code.

If this patch does not work, you may need to consider other options, such as downgrading the library version, or rewriting the code that depends on the removed classes.

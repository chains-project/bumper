Here is the updated code for the `init` method with the changes required to fix the error:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os));
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    transport.open();
}
```

In this updated code, I replaced `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport` which is the new recommended way to create a framed transport in the latest version of Apache Thrift.

Note that I also added `transport.open()` at the end of the method to ensure that the transport is open before using it.

I hope this helps!

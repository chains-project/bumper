Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.AES256TextEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    private final PBEPasswordEncoder pbePasswordEncoder;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        AES256TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new AES236TextEncrypter();
        textEncryptor.setPassword("some-secret-key-here");
        StandardPasswordEncoder standardPasswordEncoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder();
        this.pbePasswordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder(standardPasswordEncoder, textEncryptor);
    }

    //...
}
```
Here are the changes I made:

* I imported `org.jasypt.util.text.AES256TextEncryptor` and `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder` instead of `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder`.
* I created a new constructor that takes no arguments.
* In the constructor, I created a new `AES256TextEncryptor` and a new `StandardPasswordEncoder`.
* I then created a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` using the `StandardPasswordEncoder` and the `AES236TextEncryptor` as arguments.

This should fix the error by using the new `PBEPasswordEncoder` from the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package instead of the removed `PBEPasswordEncoder` from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package.

Note: You will need to replace `"some-secret-key-key-here"` with a real secret key.

Also note that the new `PBEPasswordEncoder` does not have all the same methods as the old one. In particular, it does not have a `setPbeStringEncryptor` or `setTextEncryptor` method. This means that you will not be able to change the `PBEPasswordEncoder`'s `TextEncryptor` after it has been created.

If you need to change the `TextEncryptor` after the `PBEPasswordEncoder` has been created, you will need to create a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` with a new `TextEncryptor`.

For example, you could add a setter method like this:

```
public void setTextEncryptor(String newSecretKey) {
    AES256TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new AES236TextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(newSecretKey);
    StandardPasswordEncoder standardPasswordEncoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder();
    this.pbePasswordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder(standardPasswordEncoder, textEncryptor);
}
``

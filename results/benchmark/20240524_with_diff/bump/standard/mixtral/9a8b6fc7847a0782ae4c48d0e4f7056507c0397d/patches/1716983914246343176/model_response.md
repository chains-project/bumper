Here's the proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
In this patch, I replaced `setPasswordEncryptor` with `setTextEncryptor` since the former is no longer available in the new library version. The `StrongTextEncryptor` class is a replacement for `StrongPasswordEncryptor` as it provides the same functionality.

Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEStringEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

// ...

TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new PBEStringEncryptor();
PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();
```

This patch imports the necessary classes from the updated library and creates instances of `TextEncryptor` and `PasswordEncoder` to replace the removed `PBEPasswordEncoder` class.

Note that the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` class is used as a replacement for `PBEPasswordEncoder` because it provides similar functionality. However, you may need to adjust the configuration or usage of the password encoder depending on your specific use case.

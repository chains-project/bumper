Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```

Explanation:

The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been removed in the new library version, so we need to use the `PasswordEncoder` class instead. The `setPasswordEncryptor` method has also been removed, so we need to use the `setTextEncryptor` method instead.

The `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class has been removed, so we need to use the `StrongTextEncryptor` class instead.

Note that the `encodePassword` and `isPasswordValid` methods have also been removed from the `PasswordEncoder` class, so you may need to update any client code that calls these methods.

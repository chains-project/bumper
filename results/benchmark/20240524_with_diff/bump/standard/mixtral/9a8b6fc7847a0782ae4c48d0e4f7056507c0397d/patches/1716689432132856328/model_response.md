Here'Fully qualified code`

import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

private final TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new org.jasypt.basic.BasicTextEncryptor();
private final PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new StrongPasswordEncryptor();

// Rest of the class remains unchanged
}
`This code imports the necessary classes from the updated library and creates instances of TextEncryptor and PasswordEncoder.
The rest of the class remains unchanged.

The error was caused by the removal of the org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder class.
To fix this, we can use the new classes from the updated library that provide similar functionality.

The TextEncryptor class can be used for encryption and decryption of text, while the PasswordEncoder class can be used for encoding and checking the validity of passwords.

The new instance of TextEncryptor can be used for encrypting and decrypting text, while the new instance of PasswordEncoder can be used for encoding and checking the validity of passwords.

By using these new classes, we can ensure that the code is compatible with the updated library.

Note: The above code is just a suggestion, it may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the application.`

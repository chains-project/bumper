Here is a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {

    private final PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder() {
        BasicPasswordEncryptor encryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();
        this.passwordEncoder = new PasswordEncoder() {
            @Override
            public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
                return encryptor.encryptPassword(rawPassword.toString());
            }

            @Override
            public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
                return encryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword.toString(), encodedPassword);
            }
        };
    }

    // existing methods
}
```
Explanation:

* I replaced the import statement for `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` with `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder`, which is the new location of the `PasswordEncoder` interface in the updated library.
* I created a new instance of `BasicPasswordEncryptor` to handle password encoding and decoding.
* I implemented a new `PasswordEncoder` instance that delegates to the `BasicPasswordEncryptor` instance for encoding and decoding passwords.
* I kept the existing method signatures and functionality of the `GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder` class.

Note: I am assuming that the `GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder` class is responsible for encoding and decoding passwords using the `PasswordEncoder` interface. If there are other dependencies on the removed methods of `PBEPasswordEncoder`, those will need to be addressed separately.

Here's the patched version of the `createStringEncoder` method that should fix the error:
```java
@Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
The `setPasswordEncryptor` method has been removed in the new version of the library, so we need to use the `setTextEncryptor` method instead. I've replaced `setPasswordEncryptor` with `setTextEncryptor` and changed the constructor call accordingly.

Note that I've assumed that the behavior of `StrongTextEncryptor` is similar to `StrongPasswordEncryptor`. If this is not the case, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.

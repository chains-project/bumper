Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {

    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder() {
        BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();
        this.passwordEncoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder() {
            @Override
            public String encodePassword(String rawPassword, Object salt) {
                return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPassword);
            }

            @Override
            public boolean isPasswordValid(String encryptedPassword, String rawPassword, Object salt) {
                return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword, encryptedPassword);
            }
        };
    }

    // existing methods
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `PBEPasswordEncoder` with `PasswordEncoder` and uses a `BasicPasswordEncryptor` to encrypt and validate the passwords. The `PasswordEncoder` interface is a part of Spring Security and provides a standard way to encode and validate passwords. The `BasicPasswordEncryptor` is a simple password encryptor provided by jasypt that can be used to encrypt and validate passwords.

Note that the `PasswordEncoder` interface provided by jasypt has been removed in the new library version, but the one provided by Spring Security is still available and can be used instead. The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has also been removed, but its functionality can be replicated using the `BasicPasswordEncryptor` class.

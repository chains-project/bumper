Here's a proposed patch for the `registerHard` method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes made are:

* Replacing the `SortedMap` type with the raw `Map` type for the `reg` variable. This is because the raw type is a common supertype of both `SortedMap` and the new type of the registry, which is a `TreeMap`.
* Creating a new `TreeMap` from the `reg` map when setting it to the registry. This is because the new registry type is a `TreeMap`, and the raw type `Map` cannot be directly assigned to it.

These changes should allow the code to compile and run with the new library version. However, note that the order of the registry entries may not be preserved with this approach. If preserving the order is important, a different approach may be necessary.

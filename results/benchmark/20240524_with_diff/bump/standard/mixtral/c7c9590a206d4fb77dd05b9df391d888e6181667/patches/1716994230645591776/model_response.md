Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on how the original RenderingContext was used.
        // If it wasn't used, you can remove this method.
        return null;
    }
};

// Use the new renderingContext object instead of creating it directly.
```

Explanation:

The `RenderingContext` class has been moved to a different package, so we need to import it from there instead.

The `RenderingContext` class no longer has a constructor, so we need to create an anonymous subclass and override the `getOutputName()` method, if it was used in the original code.

The `SiteRendererSink` class no longer takes a `RenderingContext` parameter in its constructor, so we don't need to create one.

The `DocumentRenderer` class has been removed, so we can't use it to get a `RenderingContext` object. Instead, we create a new `RenderingContext` object and use it directly.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext object.
        // You may need to access other objects or variables in the SCoverageReportMojo class
        // to provide the correct output name.
        return null;
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' object instead of creating a new RenderingContext object directly.
```

Explanation:

Based on the changes in the new library version, the `RenderingContext` class is no longer a part of the `xhtml.decoration.render` package. Instead, it is now a top-level class in the `siterenderer` package.

To fix the error, we can create a new `RenderingContext` object using its constructor and override the `getOutputName()` method to provide the correct output name. This method is newly added in the `RenderingContext` class, so we need to override it in our implementation.

Note that we don't know the exact usage of the `RenderingContext` object in the original code, so we can't provide a concrete implementation of the `getOutputName()` method. You may need to access other objects or variables in the `SCoverageReportMojo` class to provide the correct output name.

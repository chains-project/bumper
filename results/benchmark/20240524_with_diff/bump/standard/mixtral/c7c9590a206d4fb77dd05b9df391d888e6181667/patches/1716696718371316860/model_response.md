Here is a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext object
    }
};

// Use the new renderingContext object in the rest of the method
```
Explanation:

Since the `RenderingContext` class is no longer passed as a parameter to the `DoxiaDocumentRenderer` constructor, we need to create a new instance of `RenderingContext` ourselves.

To do this, we can create an anonymous subclass of `RenderingContext` and override the `getOutputName()` method, which was added in the new library version.

We can then use this new `renderingContext` object in the rest of the method, replacing any usage of the original `RenderingContext` object.

Note that we don't know exactly how the `getOutputName()` method should be implemented, so we leave it to the developer to fill in the details based on the specific usage of the `RenderingContext` object in the original code.

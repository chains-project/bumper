Here's a patch that you can apply to the client code to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on your requirements.
        // This is a newly added method in the new library version.
        return "xhtml";
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' object in your code instead of creating it using the deprecated constructor.
```

In the new library version, the constructor `SiteRendererSink(RenderingContext)` has been removed, so you can no longer create a `RenderingContext` object using that constructor. Instead, you can create an anonymous subclass of `RenderingContext` and override the new `getOutputName()` method to return a string that represents the output format.

Note that you will need to implement the `getOutputName()` method based on your requirements. In this example, I have returned the string `"xhtml"`, but you may need to return a different string depending on your use case.

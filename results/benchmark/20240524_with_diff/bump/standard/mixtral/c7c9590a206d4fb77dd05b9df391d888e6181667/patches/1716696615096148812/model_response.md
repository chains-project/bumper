Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext.
        // This is just a placeholder implementation.
        return "xhtml";
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' variable instead of creating it directly
// in the method call arguments.
// ...
```
This patch creates a new `RenderingContext` instance with a custom anonymous class that overrides the `getOutputName()` method. This method was added in the new library version and is used instead of the removed `getRenderingContext()` method. The new `RenderingContext` instance is then used in the method calls.

Note: You will need to replace the `// ...` with the relevant parts of the original code. Also, you may need to adjust the `getOutputName()` implementation based on the original usage of the `RenderingContext`.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on how the original RenderingContext was used.
        // You may need to inspect the surrounding code to determine the correct implementation.
        return null;
    }
};

// ...

// Replace any usage of RenderingContext with the instance created above.
```

This patch replaces the import of the removed `RenderingContext` class with the one that still exists in the updated library. It also creates an anonymous implementation of `RenderingContext` that overrides the new `getOutputName()` method. Replace any usage of `RenderingContext` with the instance created above.

Please note that you might need to modify the `getOutputName()` method implementation based on how the original `RenderingContext` was used in the code. You may need to inspect the surrounding code to determine the correct implementation.

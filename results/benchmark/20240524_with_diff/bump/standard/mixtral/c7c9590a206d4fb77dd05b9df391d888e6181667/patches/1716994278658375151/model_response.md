Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method according to your needs
        return "xhtml";
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' object in your code
```

This patch creates a new `RenderingContext` object using an anonymous inner class that overrides the `getOutputName()` method. This method was added in the new library version, and it's likely that the code you're working with needs to implement it.

You should replace the usage of `RenderingContext` in your code with the new `renderingContext` object.

Note: You may need to adjust the implementation of `getOutputName()` according to your specific use case.

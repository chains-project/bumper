Here is a patch that you can apply to the code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on your needs
        return "xhtml";
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' object instead of creating it directly
// with the deprecated constructor
```
This patch creates a new `RenderingContext` object and overrides the `getOutputName()` method to return a string that represents the output format. You will need to implement the method based on your needs.

Then, you can use the `renderingContext` object instead of creating it directly with the deprecated constructor.

Note that this patch only fixes the compilation error. It is possible that you will need to make additional changes to the code to make it work correctly with the new version of the library.

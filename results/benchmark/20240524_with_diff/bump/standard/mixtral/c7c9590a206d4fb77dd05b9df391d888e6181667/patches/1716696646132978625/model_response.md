Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on how the original RenderingContext was used.
        // If it was not used, you can safely return null.
        return null;
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' variable instead of creating a new RenderingContext instance.
```

This patch removes the dependency on the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package by creating an anonymous implementation of the `RenderingContext` interface. The `getOutputName()` method is overridden because it was added in the new library version. You will need to implement this method based on how the original `RenderingContext` was used in the code. If it was not used, you can safely return `null`. The `renderingContext` variable is then used instead of creating a new `RenderingContext` instance.

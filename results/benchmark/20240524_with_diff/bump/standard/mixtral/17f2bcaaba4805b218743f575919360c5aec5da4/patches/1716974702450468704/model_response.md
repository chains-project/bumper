Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testSize() {
        org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper index = new org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper();
        int expectedSize = 0;
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());

        index.add(new double[]{1.0, 2.0});
        expectedSize = 1;
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());

        index.add(new double[]{3.0, 4.0});
        expectedSize = 2;
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());
    }
}
```
The patch adds a new test method `testSize()` that creates an instance of `PointIndexMMWrapper`, adds some points to it, and checks the size of the index after each addition.

The patch uses the `assertEquals()` method from JUnit Jupiter to compare the expected size with the actual size returned by the `size()` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PointIndexMMWrapper` class from the external dependency still has a `size()` method that returns the number of elements in the index. If this method has been removed or renamed in the new library version, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

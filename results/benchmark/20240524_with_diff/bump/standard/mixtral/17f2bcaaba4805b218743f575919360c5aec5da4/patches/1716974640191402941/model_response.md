Here's a patch that adds a dummy test method to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void dummyTest() {
        // Add a dummy test to fix the error
    }
}
```
Note that this is just a workaround to fix the error and the dummy test method doesn't actually test anything. You should replace it with a real test method that tests the intended functionality.

Here is a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI.size;

public class MyClass {
    // existing code...

    public void myMethod() {
        int mySize = size();
        // use mySize as needed...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
In this fixed version, I've imported the `size` method from the `MinHeapI` interface using a static import. This allows us to call `size()` without qualifying it with the class or interface name, making the code simpler and easier to read.

Note that this assumes that the `size()` method from `MinHeapI` is suitable for your use case. If not, you may need to modify the import statement to use a different method or class.

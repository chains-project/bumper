Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

int size() {
    int size = 0;
    size += new org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
    size += new org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP().size();
    size += new org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap().size();
    size += new org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap().size();
    return size;
}
```
This patch creates a new `size` method that calculates the size of various classes from the updated library version. It creates new instances of `PointIndexMMWrapper`, `PHTreeMMP`, `MinHeap`, and `MinMaxHeap` and calls their `size` method to get their size. The sizes are then added together and returned.

Note that this patch assumes that the `size` method is meant to calculate the size of various classes from the updated library version. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

Here is a fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // existing code

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // existing code

        // Fix: Add a cast to (MinHeapI) to suppress the error
        int size = ((MinHeapI) minHeap).size();
    }

    // existing code
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `size()` method is now present in the `MinHeapI` interface, but the `minHeap` variable is not declared as implementing this interface. To fix the error, we can add a cast to `(MinHeapI)` when calling the `size()` method. This will inform the compiler that `minHeap` is indeed an implementation of `MinHeapI`, and allow the code to compile successfully.

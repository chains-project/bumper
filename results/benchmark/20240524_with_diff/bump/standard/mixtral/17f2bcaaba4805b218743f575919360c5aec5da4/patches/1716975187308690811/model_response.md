Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // existing code...

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // existing code...

        // The size() method was removed from the old library version,
        // but it is available in the new version. Use it to check the size of the index.
        int expectedSize = 100; // replace with the expected size
        int actualSize = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
        assertEquals(expectedSize, actualSize);

        // existing code...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
This patch adds a call to the `size()` method of the `PointIndexMMWrapper` class to check the size of the index. This method was removed in the old library version, but it is available in the new version. The patch also includes an assertion to check that the actual size of the index matches the expected size.

Here's a fixed version of the failing method. I added a dummy import statement to fix the error.

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
 
    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // some setup code here
    }

    // other test methods here
}
```
The error message suggests that the compiler expected a class, interface, or enum after the import statement. Since there are no syntax errors in the provided import statement, it seems like the problem is caused by a missing dependency.

To resolve the issue, I added an import statement for a class from the updated library. This should provide the necessary dependency for the code to compile successfully.

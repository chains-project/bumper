Here is the fixed failing method:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // existing code...

    @Test
    public void testSize() {
        // existing code...
        int expectedSize = 10;
        int actualSize = new MinHeapI() {}.size();
        assertEquals(expectedSize, actualSize);
    }
}
```
This code creates an anonymous class implementing `MinHeapI` and calls its `size()` method to get the actual size.
It assumes that the `MinHeapI` interface has a `size()` method (as indicated by the error message), but it doesn't matter which implementation of the interface is used.
If the `MinHeapI` interface doesn't have a `size()` method, you can replace it with any other implementation that has a `size()` method, such as `PointIndexMMWrapper`, `PHTreeMMP`, `MinHeap`, or `MinMaxHeap`.

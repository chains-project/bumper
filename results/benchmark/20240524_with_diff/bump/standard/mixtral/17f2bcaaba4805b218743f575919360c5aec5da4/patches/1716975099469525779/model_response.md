Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;

// add the following import statement
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // add the following method
    private void checkSize(MinHeapI heap) {
        int size = heap.size();
        assertTrue(size >= 0, "Size should be non-negative");
    }

    // modify the existing @BeforeEach method as follows
    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // existing code

        // add the following lines after creating the MinHeapI object
        checkSize((MinHeapI) minHeap);

        // existing code
    }

    // rest of the class
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a class, interface, or enum is expected at line 43, which is the line with the `@BeforeEach` annotation. It's possible that the failure is caused by a missing assertion in the `setUp()` method.
To fix the error, we can add a helper method `checkSize()` that checks if the size of a `MinHeapI` object is non-negative. We then call this method in the `setUp()` method after creating the `MinHeapI` object.
Note that we need to cast the `minHeap` object to `MinHeapI` when calling `checkSize()` because the `minHeap` object is declared as `Object` and the `size()` method is defined in the `MinHeapI` interface.
We also need to import the `Assertions.assertTrue()` method to use it in the `checkSize()` method.
Finally, we don't need to change any external dependencies as the failure is caused by the missing assertion in the client code.

Here is a fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void test() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
It appears that the error message you provided is not actually related to the code you provided. The error message indicates that there is a syntax error on line 44 of the file `PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests.java`, but the code you provided only contains a single line with no syntax errors.

Therefore, I have provided a version of the code that is identical to the code you provided, but with the necessary imports added so that it can be compiled and run. If you are still experiencing issues, please provide the full code and error message so that I can better understand the problem.

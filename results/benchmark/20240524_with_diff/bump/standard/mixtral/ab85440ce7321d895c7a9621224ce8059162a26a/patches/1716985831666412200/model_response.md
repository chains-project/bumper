Here's the proposed patch for the given client code:

```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersPushed() {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("%s: Pushed", this.image.layer()));
}
```

The patch removes the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it's causing a compilation error in the new library version.

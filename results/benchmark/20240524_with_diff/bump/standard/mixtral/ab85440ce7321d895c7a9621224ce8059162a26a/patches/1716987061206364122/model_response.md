Here's a possible patch for the failing client code, taking into account the new library version changes:

```java
private static com.artipie.http.hm.ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    return new com.artipie.http.hm.ResponseMatcher(com.artipie.http.rs.RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Location", new org.hamcrest.core.StringStartsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")),
        new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new org.hamcrest.core.IsNot(org.hamcrest.Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In the original code, the `StringStartsWith` constructor was being called with two arguments instead of one. This has been corrected by removing the `false` argument.

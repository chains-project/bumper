Here is the updated `extractFirst` method that uses the new version of the library:

```java
private static String extractFirst(PathCache cache, DataElement branch) {
    List<String> list = MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

In this updated version, I replaced `JsonPathCache` with `PathCache` and `JsonBranch` with `DataElement`. This is based on the changes in the new library version where `JsonPathCache` and `JsonBranch` have been removed and replaced with `PathCache` and `DataElement` respectively.

Here's the proposed patch for the `decodeCiphertext` method:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.GeneralSecurityException;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import org.bouncycastle.util.Arrays;

public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] additionalData, byte[] ciphertext) throws IOException {
    SecretKeySpec macKey = initRecordMAC(decryptCipher);
    byte[] calculatedMAC = PolyKeyCreator.create(macKey, additionalData, ciphertext);
    if (!Arrays.constantTimeAreEqual(calculatedMAC, receivedMAC)) {
        throw new GeneralSecurityException("bad_record_mac");
    }
    byte[] output = new byte[ciphertext.length];
    decryptCipher.doFinal(ciphertext, 0, ciphertext.length, output, 0);
    return output;
}
```

In this patch, I have addressed the missing package error by using the `javax.crypto` package for encryption and decryption. I replaced the `TlsFatalAlert` class with a custom `GeneralSecurityException` to maintain the same behavior. The `processBytes` method has been replaced with the `doFinal` method from the `Cipher` class.

Note: In order for this patch to work, you may need to update the `initRecordMAC` method to return a `SecretKeySpec` instead of a `KeyParameter`. Also, make sure the `PolyKeyCreator` class and the `decryptCipher` are properly initialized.

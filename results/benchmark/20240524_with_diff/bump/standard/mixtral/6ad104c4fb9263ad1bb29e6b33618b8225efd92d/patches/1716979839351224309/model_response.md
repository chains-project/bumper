Here's the patched method using the Bouncy Castle Fork from here: <https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java>

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.CryptoException;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.DataLengthException;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;
import org.bouncycastle.util.Arrays;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] additionalData, byte[] ciphertext) throws IOException {
    KeyParameter macKey = initRecordMAC(decryptCipher);
    byte[] calculatedMAC = io.github.hapjava.server.impl.crypto.PolyKeyCreator.create(macKey, additionalData, ciphertext);
    if (!Arrays.constantTimeAreEqual(calculatedMAC, receivedMAC)) {
        throw new CryptoException("bad_record_mac");
    }
    byte[] output = new byte[ciphertext.length];
    try {
        decryptCipher.processBytes(ciphertext, 0, ciphertext.length, output, 0);
    } catch (DataLengthException e) {
        throw new IOException("Failed to decrypt ciphertext", e);
    }
    return output;
}
```

This patch replaces the removed classes from the Bouncy Castle library with the equivalent functionality from the Bouncy Castle Fork. The `TlsFatalAlert` class has been replaced with a custom `CryptoException` and the `DataLengthException` is handled while decrypting the ciphertext. The `SecureRandom` class is not used in this method, so it has been removed.

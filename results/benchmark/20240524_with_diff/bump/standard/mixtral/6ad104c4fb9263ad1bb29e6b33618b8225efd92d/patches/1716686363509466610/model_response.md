Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new TlsFatalAlert(TlsFatalAlert.INTERNAL_ERROR);
}
```
The changes made include importing the `TlsFatalAlert` class directly from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package, and throwing a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance with the `INTERNAL_ERROR` alert description when an exception occurs. This should fix the error caused by the removal of the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor in the updated library version.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
import org.bouncycastle.openssl.TlsFatalAlert;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new TlsFatalAlert((short) 80); // replace with appropriate error code
}
```

In this patch, we import the `TlsFatalAlert` class from the `org.bouncycastle.openssl` package instead of the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package. This is because the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor and `getAlertDescription()` method have been removed from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package in the new library version.

Instead, we can use the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor from the `org.bouncycastle.openssl` package to create a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance, passing in the appropriate error code as a short value. Note that we need to replace the error code `(short) 80` with the appropriate error code for the specific exception being caught.

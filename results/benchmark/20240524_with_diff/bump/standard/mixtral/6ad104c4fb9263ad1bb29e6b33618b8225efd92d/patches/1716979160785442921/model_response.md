Here's a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsUtils;

// ...

try {
    // Use TlsUtils.alert(short) instead of TlsFatalAlert(short)
    TlsUtils.alert(TlsUtils.AlertDescription.internal_error);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```
Explanation:
The `TlsFatalAlert` constructor has been removed in the new library version, so we need to use the `TlsUtils.alert(short)` method instead. We can still use `TlsUtils.AlertDescription` to specify the alert description.

Note: I had to add a try-catch block to handle the potential exception that might be thrown. You should replace the comment `// Handle exception` with appropriate error handling code for your use case.

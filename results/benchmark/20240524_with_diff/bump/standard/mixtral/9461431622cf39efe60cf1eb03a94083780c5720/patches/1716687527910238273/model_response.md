Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

Here are the changes I made:

* I changed the type of `reg` from `SortedMap` to `Map`, because the former is not compatible with the latter, as indicated by the error message.
* I added a call to `new TreeMap<>(reg)` when setting the value of `registry`, because the `registry` field is declared as a `SortedMap`, and the `put` method of `Map` does not preserve the order of elements.
* I removed the `final` modifier from `reg`, because it's not necessary and might prevent some operations, such as the constructor of `TreeMap`.
* I removed the `import` statement for `SortedMap`, because it's not used anymore.
* I added a generic type parameter to `TreeMap`, because it's required by the Java compiler.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Here is a possible patch for the `registerHard` method that should fix the type compatibility error:

```java
    private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);           
            Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = new TreeMap<>(server.getRegistry());
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
        }
    }
```

The changes I made are:

1. I replaced the `SortedMap` generic type with `Map`, because the error message suggests that the problem is caused by an incompatible generic type.
2. I created a new `TreeMap` from the original registry to avoid any problems with the original `SortedMap` implementation.
2. I wrapped the new `TreeMap` with another `TreeMap` when setting it back to the `registry` field, because the error message suggests that the new version of the library expects a `SortedMap` instead of a `Map`.

Note that this solution assumes that the new version of the library still uses a `TreeMap` to implement the registry. If that's not the case, then you might need to adjust the generic type of the `TreeMap` accordingly.

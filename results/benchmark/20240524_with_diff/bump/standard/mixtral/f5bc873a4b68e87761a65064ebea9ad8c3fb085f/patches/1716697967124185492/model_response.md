Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import org.apache.myfaces.tobago.theme.Theme;
import org.apache.myfaces.tobago.util.ThemeUtilities;

// ...

File themeFile = ...; // initialize the File object

// Use the new static method added in the library
Theme theme = ThemeUtilities.loadTheme(themeFile);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a class, interface, or enum is expected at line 92 of the file `AbstractThemeMojo.java`. This could be due to the removal of a class or interface from the library.

To fix this, we can use the new static method `loadTheme` added in the library, which loads a theme from a file. This method is located in the `ThemeUtilities` class.

We can create a `File` object to represent the theme file, and then pass it to the `loadTheme` method to load the theme. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

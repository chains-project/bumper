Here is the patch for the client code:

```java
import java.io.File;
import org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo;

public class AbstractThemeMojo extends AbstractMojo {
    // existing fields and methods

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        // existing code

        File file = new File("some-file-path");
        // use 'file' instead of the removed library method

        // existing code
    }
}
```

Note: The patch assumes that the removed library method was used to create a `File` object. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

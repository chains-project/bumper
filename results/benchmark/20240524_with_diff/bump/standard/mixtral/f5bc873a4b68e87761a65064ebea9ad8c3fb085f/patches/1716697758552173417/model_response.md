Here is a potential patch for the client code to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
import org.eclipse.tycho.core.TychoProject;

// ...

protected MavenProject getMavenProject() {
    MavenProject mavenProject = null;
    if (project instanceof TychoProject) {
        TychoProject tychoProject = (TychoProject) project;
        Model model = tychoProject.getModel();
        mavenProject = new MavenProject(model);
    }
    return mavenProject;
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` class cannot be found, which suggests that the `maven-project` module has been removed from the library.

To fix this, we can use the `Model` class from the `maven-model` module to create a new `MavenProject` object.

The `TychoProject` class from the `tycho-core` module can be used to get the `Model` object, which can then be used to create a new `MavenProject` object.

Note that this patch assumes that the `project` variable is of type `org.eclipse.tycho.core.TychoProject`. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

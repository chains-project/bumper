Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    Model model = // get your model here (e.g. from a MavenSession or a MavenProject)
    return new MavenProject(model);
}
```

Explanation:

The error message suggests that the `MavenProject` class is not found, which might be due to a removed import statement. To fix this, we need to make sure that the `MavenProject` class is imported correctly.

However, it's also possible that the `MavenProject` constructor has been removed in the new library version, which could cause a compilation error if it's used directly. To work around this, we can create a new `MavenProject` instance using its constructor that takes a `Model` object as a parameter.

Note that the `Model` object can be obtained from a `MavenSession` or a `MavenProject` instance. You'll need to modify the code to get the `Model` object based on your specific use case.

Here's the patched method that uses the fully qualified name of `MavenProject` to fix the error:

```java
public org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject getProject() {
    return org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
}
```
However, I assume that this is not what you intended. If you meant to return the `project` variable, but it's not declared or initialized in the method, you can modify the method as follows:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    MavenProject project = null; // initialize the project variable
    // ... assign a value to project, e.g. by getting it from a dependency or a method parameter
    return project;
}
```
Note that you need to replace the `null` initialization and the comment `// ...` with the actual code that initializes the `project` variable.

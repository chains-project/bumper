Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.FileUtils;

//...

File themeDir = new File(basedir, "src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/theme");
FileUtils.deleteDirectory(themeDir);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that there is a problem with the code on line 92 of the file `AbstractThemeMojo.java`. Based on the provided code snippet, it is likely that the problem is caused by a missing method call to delete the directory.
To fix the issue, I added an import statement for `FileUtils` class, which provides a convenient method to delete a directory. Then, I created a variable `themeDir` to represent the directory to be deleted, and called the `FileUtils.deleteDirectory` method to delete the directory.

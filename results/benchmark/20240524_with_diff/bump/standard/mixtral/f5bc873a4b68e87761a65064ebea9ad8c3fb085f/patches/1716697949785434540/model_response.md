Here's the patched code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import org.apache.myfaces.tobago.theme.Theme;

public class AbstractThemeMojo {
    // ...

    private Theme theme;

    // ...

    protected void initTheme() {
        File themeDir = new File("src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/org/apache/myfaces/tobago/theme");
        this.theme = Theme.load(themeDir);
    }

    // ...
}
```
In this patch, I've added the import statement for `org.apache.myfaces.tobago.theme.Theme` and created a new private variable `theme` of type `Theme`. The `initTheme` method has been updated to load a `Theme` instance from the specified directory. This change should resolve the error caused by the missing `Theme` class.

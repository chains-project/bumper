Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
import org.eclipse.tycho.core.shared.MavenContext;
import org.eclipse.tycho.core.shared.MavenProjectFacade;

// ...

Model model = project.getModel();
MavenContext mavenContext = new MavenContext(session, repositorySystem, repoSession);
MavenProjectFacade mavenProjectFacade = new MavenProjectFacade(model, mavenContext);
MavenProject mavenProject = mavenProjectFacade.createProject();
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` class is not found, which suggests that the `maven-project` dependency might have been removed or changed.
To fix this issue, we can create a new `MavenProject` instance using the `MavenProjectFacade` class from the `tycho-core` library, which is a replacement for the removed `maven-project` library.
By doing this, we can avoid directly depending on the removed `maven-project` library and use the new `tycho-core` library instead.
Note that we also need to import the `Model` class from the `maven-model` library and the `MavenContext` and `MavenProjectFacade` classes from the `tycho-core` library.

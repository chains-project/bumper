Here is a fixed version of the failing method that should resolve the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```

The error message suggests that the `MavenProject` class cannot be found, so I added an import statement at the beginning of the method to import the class explicitly. This should allow the code to compile and run correctly.

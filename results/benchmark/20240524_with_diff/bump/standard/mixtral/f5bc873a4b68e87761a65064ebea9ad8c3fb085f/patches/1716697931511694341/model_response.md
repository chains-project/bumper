Here is the patch for the client code:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// replace the failing code
// File file = new File("/path/to/file");

File file = Paths.get("/path/to/file").toFile();
```

The failure is caused by the fact that the `File` class constructor accepting a string as a parameter has been removed in the new library version. To fix this, we can use the `Paths.get(...).toFile()` method to achieve the same effect.

Here's the patched version of the failing method that imports the missing `MavenProject` class from the correct package:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```

This patch imports the `MavenProject` class from the `org.apache.maven.project` package, which should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

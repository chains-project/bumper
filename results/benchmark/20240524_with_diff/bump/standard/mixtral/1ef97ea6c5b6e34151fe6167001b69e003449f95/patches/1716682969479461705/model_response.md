Here is the updated `between` method that should fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

// Add these two lines after the between method
import java.sql.Timestamp;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

// Replace the following line in the between method
// return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
// With these two lines
Timestamp superBetween = super.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime()));
return new Timcasting.java.sql.Timestamp(superBetween.getTime());

// The updated between method
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    Timestamp superBetween = super.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime()));
    return new Timestamp(superBetween.getTime());
}
```

The changes include importing the `java.sql.Timestamp` class and the `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit` class at the top of the file.

In the `between` method, we create `Timestamp` objects for the `from` and `to` arguments and pass them to the `super.between` method.

We then extract the `Timestamp` object returned by `super.between` and create a new `Timestamp` object using its `getTime` method.

This should fix the incompatible types error.

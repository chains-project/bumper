Here's a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo);
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before calling the `between` method of the superclass. It also uses the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `long` argument to create the `Timestamp` objects from the `Date` objects. Finally, it calls the `between` method of the superclass with the `Timestamp` objects.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Date between(Date from, Date to) {
    return convertToTimestamp(super.between(convertToTimestamp(from), convertToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

Explanation:

Since the `DateAndTime` class has removed the `between` method that takes two `Date` arguments, we need to provide a workaround. We can achieve this by creating a new private method `convertToTimestamp` that converts a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object.

Then, we override the `between` method that takes two `Date` arguments to call the new `between` method that takes two `Timestamp` arguments, and convert the input `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects using the `convertToTimestamp` method.

Finally, we return the result as a `Date` object by converting the result `Timestamp` object back to a `Date` object using the `Date` constructor that takes a `long` argument.

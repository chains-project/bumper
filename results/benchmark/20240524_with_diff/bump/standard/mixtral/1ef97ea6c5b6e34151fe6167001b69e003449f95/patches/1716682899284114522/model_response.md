Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertDateToTimestamp(from), convertDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

This patch introduces a new private method `convertDateToTimestamp` to convert a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object. The original `between` method is then overridden to use this new method to convert the `Date` objects returned by the superclass's `between` method to `Timestamp` objects. This allows the method to use the new `Timestamp`-based `between` method introduced in the updated library version while still maintaining the original method signature.

Here'1s the updated `between` method that takes into account the changes in the new library version:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp fromSql = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp toSql = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return super.between(fromSql, toSql);
}
``z
```
The key change here is converting the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` before calling the new `between` method in the superclass.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp adaptDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return adaptDateToTimestamp(super.between(adaptDateToTimestamp(from), adaptDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

Explanation:

The issue is caused by the fact that the new version of the library has removed the `DateAndTime.between(Date, Date)` method and replaced it with `DateAndTime.between(Timestamp, Timestamp)`.

To fix the issue, we need to convert the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before passing them to the `super.between()` method.

The `adaptDateToTimestamp()` method is introduced to convert a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object.

The original `between()` method is kept for backward compatibility, and it delegates to a new `between()` method that converts the input `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects using the `adaptDateToTimestamp()` method.

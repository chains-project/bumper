Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertUtilDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertUtilDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertUtilDateToTimestamp(from), convertUtilDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```
This solution converts the `java.util.Date` objects to `java.sql.Timestamp` before calling the `between` method of the superclass. It does this by introducing a new private helper method `convertUtilDateToTimestamp` that takes a `java.util.Date` and returns a `java.sql.Timestamp`. This allows the original implementation of the `between` method to remain unchanged, while still ensuring type compatibility with the new version of the library.

Note that this solution assumes that the `between` method of the superclass still behaves the same way as before, i.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
This patch should fix the incompatible types error by converting the `Date` objects returned by the superclass's `between` method to `Timestamp` using the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor.

However, I notice that the new library version has added a new `between` method that takes `Timestamp` arguments in the `DateAndTime` class. Therefore, you might want to consider using `Timestamp` instead of `Date` for the `from` and `to` arguments in the `between` method.

Here is an updated version of the patch that uses `Timestamp` instead of `Date`:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return super.between(from, to);
}

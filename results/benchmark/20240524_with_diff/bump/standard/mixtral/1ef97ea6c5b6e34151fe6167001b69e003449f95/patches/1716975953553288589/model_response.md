Here's the fixed failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This method is already correct and doesn't need any changes. The error message you're seeing is caused by a type mismatch between `Date` and `Timestamp`. To fix the error, you need to update the method signature to use `Timestamp` instead of `Date`. Here's an example:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

Note that you'll need to update any calls to this method to use `Timestamp` instead of `Date`.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, since the `DateAndTime.between(Date, Date)` method has been removed in the new library version, the above code will still fail to compile. To fix the error, you can modify the code as follows:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo).getTime());
}
```

This code creates `java.sql.Timestamp` objects for the input `Date` objects and passes them to the `DateAndTime.between(Timestamp, Timestamp)` method. The result is then converted back to a `java.sql.Timestamp` object before being returned.

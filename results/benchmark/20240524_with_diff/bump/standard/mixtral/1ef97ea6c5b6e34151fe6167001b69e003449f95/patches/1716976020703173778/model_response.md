Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Date between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertToTimestamp(super.between(from, to));
}
```

The `convertToTimestamp` method is added to convert the `Date` object returned by the superclass method to a `Timestamp` object. The original method is kept for backward compatibility, but it calls the new `convertToTimestamp` method to ensure the correct type is returned.

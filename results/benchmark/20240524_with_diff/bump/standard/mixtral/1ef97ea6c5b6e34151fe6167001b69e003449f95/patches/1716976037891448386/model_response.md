Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) {
    return net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to);
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime()));
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` arguments to `Timestamp` using the constructor, and then calls the new `between` method that takes `Timestamp` arguments. The new `between` method then calls the added library method `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(Timestamp, Timestamp)`.

Note that the `Override` decorator is kept for the original `between` method to ensure compatibility with the super class.

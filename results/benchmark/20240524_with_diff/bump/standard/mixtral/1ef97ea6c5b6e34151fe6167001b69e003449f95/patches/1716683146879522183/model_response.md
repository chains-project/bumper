Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertDateToTimestamp(from), convertDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

The patch converts the `Date` objects returned by the superclass method to `Timestamp` objects before returning them. This is necessary because the superclass method now returns a `Timestamp` object instead of a `Date` object. The `convertDateToTimestamp` method is used to simplify the code and make it easier to understand.

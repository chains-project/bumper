Here' proposed patch to fix the failing `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timcast paramter to Timestamp
    (to.getTime())).getTime());
}
```
This solution works by converting the `Date` parameters to `Timestamp` before calling the `between` method in the superclass. This way, the returned value will be a `Timestamp` and can be assigned to a `Timestamp` variable without causing a type mismatch error.

Here's the updated `between` method that should fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

// Add the following method to convert Date to Timestamp
public Timestamp toTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

// Modify the between method to use the new helper method
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return toTimestamp(super.between(from, to));
}
```

The updated method converts the `Date` object returned by `super.between` to a `Timestamp` object using the new helper method `toTimestamp`. This avoids the incompatible types error.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertDateToTimestamp(from), convertDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

The `convertDateToTimestamp` method is added to convert `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects, as the `between` method in the superclass now returns a `Timestamp` instead of a `Date`. The original `between` method is then overridden to use this new method and ensure type compatibility.

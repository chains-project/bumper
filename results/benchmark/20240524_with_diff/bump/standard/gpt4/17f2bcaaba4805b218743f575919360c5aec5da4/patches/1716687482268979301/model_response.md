The error message indicates that the static import is trying to import a method from a class or interface that doesn't exist. Since no changes related to the `org.junit.Assume` class or its `assumeTrue` method are mentioned in the library updates, the issue might be related to the classpath or the version of the JUnit library used in the project.

Unfortunately, as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, I cannot fix classpath or library version issues. I can only suggest code changes. In this case, there are no code changes I can suggest.

Please check your project's classpath and the version of the JUnit library you're using. If the problem persists, consider asking for help on a platform like StackOverflow, providing all the relevant details about your project.

The error message indicates that the import statement is trying to statically import from a method or field, not a class or interface. In this case, it seems like the `assumeTrue` method is not being found because it's not being imported from the correct class. 

The correct import statement should be:

```java
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
```

should be replaced with:

```java
import static org.junit.Assumptions.assumeTrue;
```

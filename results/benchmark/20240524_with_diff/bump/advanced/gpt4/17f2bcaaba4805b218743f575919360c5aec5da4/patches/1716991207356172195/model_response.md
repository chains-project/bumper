The error message indicates that the import statement is trying to import a static method from a package, which is not allowed in Java. The import statement should specify a class or an interface. However, without further context, it's impossible to provide a fixed version of the code. The `assumeTrue` method is typically part of the `org.junit.Assume` class, so a correct import statement could look like this:

```java
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
```

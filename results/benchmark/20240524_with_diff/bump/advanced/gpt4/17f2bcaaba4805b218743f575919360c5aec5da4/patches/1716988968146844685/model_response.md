The error message indicates that the static import is not from a class or interface. The code provided does not show any usage of the imported static method. Since the error is related to a static import, and there is no further information about how this import is used in the rest code, the most straightforward fix would be to remove the problematic import. 

Here is the fixed code:

```java
// import removed
```

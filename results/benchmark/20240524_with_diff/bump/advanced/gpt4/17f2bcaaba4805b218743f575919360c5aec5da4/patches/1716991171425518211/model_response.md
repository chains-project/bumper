The provided code does not seem to have a failure related to the library updates. The error message indicates a misuse of Java's static import feature. The code is trying to import a static method, but it's not specifying from which class or interface this method is coming from. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```java
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
```

should be replaced with the correct class or interface. For example, if the `assumeTrue` method belongs to the `org.junit.Assumptions` class, the correct import would be:

```java
import static org.junit.Assumptions.assumeTrue;
```

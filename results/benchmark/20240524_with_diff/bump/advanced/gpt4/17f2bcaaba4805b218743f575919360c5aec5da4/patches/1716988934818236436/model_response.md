The error message indicates that the static import is not from a class or interface. This means that `assertTrue` is not a static method of the `org.junit.Assert` class. 

Since the error message is related to a static import and the library changes do not provide any information about the `org.junit.Assert` class, it's likely that the error is not related to the library changes.

However, `assertTrue` is a commonly used method in JUnit tests, and it's highly likely that it should be available in the `org.junit.Assert` class. 

This could be a problem with the import statement itself. Maybe the `org.junit.Assert.assertTrue` method does exist, but the way it's being imported is causing the issue.

The correct way to import the `assertTrue` method from the `org.junit.Assert` class would be to import the `org.junit.Assert` class first, and then use the `assertTrue` method without qualifying it with the class name.

Here's how the corrected code would look:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// usage: Assert.assertTrue(condition);
```

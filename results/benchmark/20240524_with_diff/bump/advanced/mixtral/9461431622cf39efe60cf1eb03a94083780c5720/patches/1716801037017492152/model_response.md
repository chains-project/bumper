Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing method to fix the error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes I made are:

* I replaced the type of the `reg` variable from `SortedMap` to `Map`. This is because the error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between the type of the `reg` variable and the type of the value being set on the `registry` field. By changing the type of the `reg` variable to `Map`, I am able to avoid this type mismatch.
* I wrapped the value of the `reg` variable in a `TreeMap` when setting it on the `registry` field. This is because the `registry` field expects a `SortedMap` as its value, and the `TreeMap` class implements the `SortedMap` interface. This ensures that the type of the value being set on the `registry` field is compatible with the expected type.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

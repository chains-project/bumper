Here is a fixed version of the `registerHard` method that should resolve the type mismatch error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The only change made is the addition of a `@SuppressWarnings` annotation to suppress the unchecked assignment warning that results from the type mismatch. This is necessary because the type of the `reg` variable cannot be changed without modifying the `BaseAgent` class.

Note that this is not an ideal solution, and it would be better to modify the `BaseAgent` class to use a generic type parameter for the `registry` field and the `getRegistry` method. This would allow the type of the `reg` variable to be declared explicitly and avoid the need for the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation. However, since the question specifies that the client code cannot be modified, this is not an option in this case.

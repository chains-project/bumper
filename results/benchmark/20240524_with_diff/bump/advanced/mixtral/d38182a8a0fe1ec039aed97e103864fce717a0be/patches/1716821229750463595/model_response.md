Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Slice slice(String action) {
    return new DockerSlice(new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()), new Permissions.Single(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), action), new BearerAuthScheme((token) -> CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB).filter(user -> token.equals(token(user))).map(user -> new AuthUser(user.name(), user.authContext())).findFirst()), ""));
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the usage of the deprecated `User` class with the new `AuthUser` class, which has a constructor that takes a name and an auth context. I also imported the fully qualified name of the `AuthUser` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TestAuthentication` class has a `authContext()` method that returns a string. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the constructor argument for `AuthUser` accordingly.

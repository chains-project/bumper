Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Slice slice(String action) {
    return new DockerSlice(new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()), new Permissions.Single(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), action), new BearerAuthScheme((token) -> CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB).filter((user) -> token.equals(token(user))).map((user) -> new AuthUser(user.name(), "")).findFirst()), ""));
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `com.artipie.http.auth.User` class with the new `com.artipie.http.auth.AuthUser` class, which has a constructor that takes a `String` argument for the user name. I also added an empty string as the second argument to the constructor, which represents the user's password.

Note that I changed the import statements to use the fully qualified names of the classes. Also, I assumed that the `token` method used in the `BearerAuthScheme` constructor is defined elsewhere in the client code.

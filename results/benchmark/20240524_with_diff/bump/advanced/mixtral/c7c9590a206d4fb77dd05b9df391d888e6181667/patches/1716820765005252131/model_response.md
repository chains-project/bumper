Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on how the original RenderingContext was used.
        // You might need to look at the usage of getOutputName() in the client code.
        return null;
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' variable instead of creating it directly.
```

This patch replaces the import of the removed `RenderingContext` class with the new one, and creates a new anonymous implementation of the `RenderingContext` interface. The `getOutputName()` method is left unimplemented, as it was not present in the previous version of the class. You'll need to implement it based on how the original `RenderingContext` was used in the client code.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProjectBuilder;

// ...

MavenProject mavenProject = MavenProjectBuilder.buildFromRepository(projectId, null, remoteRepos, localRepository, null);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` class is not found, which suggests that the `maven-project` dependency might have been removed or changed in a way that breaks compatibility.

To fix the issue, we can use the `MavenProjectBuilder` class to build a `MavenProject` instance instead of directly instantiating it. The `MavenProjectBuilder` class is available in the `maven-builder-support` library, which is a common dependency for Maven plugins.

Note that the `MavenProjectBuilder` class requires a `ProjectBuilderConfiguration` object as its second argument, but we can pass `null` for now since we don't need any custom configuration. If the build fails later due to missing configuration, we may need to create an instance of `ProjectBuilderConfiguration` and pass it to the `MavenProjectBuilder.buildFromRepository` method.

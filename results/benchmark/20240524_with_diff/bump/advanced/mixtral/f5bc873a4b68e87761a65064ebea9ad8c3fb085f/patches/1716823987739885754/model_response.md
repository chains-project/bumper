Here is a fixed version of the failing method using a fully qualified name for `MavenProject`:

```java
public org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject getProject() {
    return org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
}
```

This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error. Note that this is just a temporary fix and the underlying issue of the missing dependency should be resolved by adding the appropriate dependency to the project's build configuration.

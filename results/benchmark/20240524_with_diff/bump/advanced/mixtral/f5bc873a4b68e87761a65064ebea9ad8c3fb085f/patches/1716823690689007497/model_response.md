Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
import org.eclipse.tycho.core.TychoProject;

// ...

protected MavenProject getMavenProject() {
    TychoProject tychoProject = (TychoProject) project;
    Model model = tychoProject.getModel();
    return new MavenProject(model);
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` class is not found. This class is part of the Maven core, which is not included in Tycho by default. To fix this issue, you can create a `MavenProject` instance using the Tycho project's model. This is done by getting the model from the Tycho project, and then creating a new `MavenProject` instance using the model. This way, you can avoid the dependency on the Maven core.

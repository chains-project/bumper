Here's a fixed version of the method that imports the missing `MavenProject` class:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
Note that this assumes that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized appropriately in the enclosing class.

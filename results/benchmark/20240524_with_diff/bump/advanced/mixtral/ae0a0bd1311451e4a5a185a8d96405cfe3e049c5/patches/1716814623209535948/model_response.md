Here's the fixed `layersPushed` method with the error resolved:

```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersPushed() {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.IsNot(new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains("<some-value>: Pushed"));
}
```

In the original code, there was a missing constant value for the `StringContains` constructor. I replaced `this.image.layer()` with a constant value `<some-value>` for demonstration purposes. Replace `<some-value>` with the appropriate layer value from your code.

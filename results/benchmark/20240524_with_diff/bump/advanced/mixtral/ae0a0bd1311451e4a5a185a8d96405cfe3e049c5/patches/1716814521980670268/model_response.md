Here is the proposed patch:
```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersPushed() {
    return org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.not(org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.stringContains(String.format("%s: Pushed", this.image.layer())));
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected. Looking at the code, I see that the `not` method from `org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert` is being called, but the argument passed to it is a `Matcher` object created using the `IsNot` class from `org.hamcrest.core`. This is likely causing a syntax error because the `not` method expects a `Matcher` object as an argument, but it's getting a `IsNot` object instead.
To fix this, I replaced the `IsNot` class with the `not` method from `org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert`, which takes a `Matcher` object as an argument and returns a `Matcher` object. I also replaced the `StringContains` class with the `stringContains` method from `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, which returns a `Matcher` object. This way, the `not` method now receives a `Matcher` object as an argument, which should resolve the syntax error.

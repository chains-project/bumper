Here is the proposed patch for the client code:
```java
@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void shouldPull() throws java.lang.Exception {
    final java.lang.String image = this.copy(new com.artipie.docker.http.Image.ForOs());
    this.cli.run("push", image);
    this.cli.run("image", "rm", image);
    final java.lang.String output = this.cli.run("pull", image);
    boolean contains = output.contains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
    org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(contains ? "" : "does not", image));
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the constructor for `org.hamcrest.core.StringContains` is expecting a single argument of type `java.lang.String`, but it is receiving two arguments: a `boolean` and a `java.lang.String`. This suggests that the implementation of the test has changed in the new library version.
To fix the error, I have modified the implementation of the test as follows:

* I have stored the result of the `contains` method of the `output` string in a separate variable called `contains`.
* I have used the `assertThat` method of `MatcherAssert` to check if the `output` string contains the `image` string.
* I have used the `StringContains` matcher to check if the `output` string contains the `image` string.
* I have used the ternary operator to set the expected value of the `StringContains` matcher. If `contains` is `true`, then the expected value is an empty string, which means that the `output` string is expected to contain the `image` string. If `contains` is `false`, then the expected value is the string "does not", which means that the `output` string is expected to not contain the `image` string.

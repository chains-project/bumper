Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes made are:

* Replacing `SortedMap` with `Map` for the `reg` variable. This is because the `getRegistry()` method now returns a `Map` instead of a `SortedMap`.
* Wrapping the `reg` variable with a `TreeMap` when setting it to the `registry` field. This is to ensure that the registry remains sorted, as required by the `SortedMap` interface.

Note that the `++` notation is not used in the code above, as it is not necessary. The `Map` interface is still implemented by the `TreeMap` class, so the code should still work as expected.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testSize() {
        org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper index = new org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper();
        int expectedSize = 0;
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());
        
        index.add(new double[]{1.0, 2.0});
        expectedSize = 1;
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());
    }
}
```
In this patch, I added a new test method `testSize()` that demonstrates how to use the `size()` method from the updated `PointIndexMMWrapper` class. The test creates an instance of `PointIndexMMWrapper`, checks its initial size, adds a point to it, and checks its size again. This test should help you verify that the `size()` method works as expected with the new version of the library.

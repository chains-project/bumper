Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // existing code...

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // existing code...

        // Verify that the index size is greater than zero
        assertTrue(index.size() > 0);

        // existing code...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, I added a statement to verify that the size of the index is greater than zero. This is possible because the `size()` method has been added to several classes in the updated library version. The specific class to use will depend on the type of the `index` variable in the `setUp()` method. You may need to adjust the import statement depending on the package of the `assertTrue()` method.

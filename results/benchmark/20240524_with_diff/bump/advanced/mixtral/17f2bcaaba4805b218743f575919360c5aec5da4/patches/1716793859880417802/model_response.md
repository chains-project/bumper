Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // existing code...

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // existing code...

        // Verify that the index size is greater than zero
        assertTrue(index.size() > 0);
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
The patch adds a static import for `Assertions.assertTrue` and uses it to verify that the size of the index is greater than zero. This assumes that `index` is an instance variable of the test class and has been properly initialized. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // Add a test method that checks the size of an instance of MinHeap
    @Test
    public void testMinHeapSize() {
        org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap<Integer> minHeap = new org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap<>();
        minHeap.add(1);
        minHeap.add(2);
        minHeap.add(3);
        int expectedSize = 3;
        int actualSize = minHeap.size();
        assertEquals(expectedSize, actualSize);
    }
}
```
The failure is caused by the fact that the client code doesn't import or use any of the new methods added in the updated library version. To fix the error, I added a new test method that creates an instance of `MinHeap` and checks its size. This ensures that the code now uses one of the new methods added in the updated library version.

Note that I didn't need to modify the existing code, since it's already valid Java code. I only added new code to the file.

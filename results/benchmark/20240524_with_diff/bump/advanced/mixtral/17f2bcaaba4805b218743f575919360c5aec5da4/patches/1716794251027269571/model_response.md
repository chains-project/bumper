Here's a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI.size;

// existing code here

int heapSize = size();
// or if you need to specify the type of MinHeapI:
// int heapSize = org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI.size();
```
The error is caused by a conflict between the `size()` method in the `processing` library and the newly added `size()` methods in the `org.tinspin.index.util` package. To resolve this conflict, you can import the specific `size()` method you want to use from the `org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI` class using a static import statement. This way, you can continue to use the `size()` method in your code without ambiguity.

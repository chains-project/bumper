Here is a fixed version of the failing method that should resolve the dependency update issue:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // existing code

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // existing code

        // Fix: Use the size() method from MinHeapI instead of a class, interface, or enum
        int size = new org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI() {}.size();

        // existing code
    }
}
```
The above code creates an anonymous class that implements the `MinHeapI` interface and then calls the `size()` method on it. This should resolve the error message `class, interface, or enum expected` since `size()` is now being called on an object instead of an interface.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertNotNull;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    private MinHeapI minHeap;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        minHeap = new MinMaxHeap(); // use any implementation of MinHeapI
        assertNotNull(minHeap);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* I added an import statement for `Assertions` from JUnit Jupiter to use the `assertNotNull` method.
* I created a private variable `minHeap` of type `MinHeapI` and initialized it in the `setUp` method.
* I added an `assertNotNull` statement to check that the `minHeap` variable is not `null`.

Note:

* I assumed that the `MinHeapI` interface is still present in the new library version since it is used in the `setUp` method.
* If the `MinHeapI` interface is no longer present, you can use any implementation of `MinHeap` or `MinMaxHeap` instead.
* If none of the available classes or interfaces can be used, you may need to modify the code to use a different data structure or library.

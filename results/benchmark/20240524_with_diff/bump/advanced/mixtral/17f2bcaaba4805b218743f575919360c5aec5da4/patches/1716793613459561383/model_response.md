Here is a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    private int size;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        // Initialize the size variable with the size of an index or heap object
        // For example, use a PointIndexMMWrapper, PHTreeMMP, MinHeap, or MinMaxHeap object
        org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper index = new org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper();
        size = index.size();

        // Alternatively, use a MinHeap or MinMaxHeap object
        // org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap<Integer> minHeap = new org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap<>(10);
        // size = minHeap.size();

        // Assert that the size is greater than 0
        assertTrue(size > 0);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we initialize the `size` variable with the size of an index or heap object, such as a `PointIndexMMWrapper`, `PHTreeMMP`, `MinHeap`, or `MinMaxHeap` object. We then assert that the size is greater than 0.

Note that the specific index or heap object used to initialize the `size` variable is not important, as long as it has a `size()` method. You can choose the object that best fits your use case.

Additionally, we have imported the `Assertions` class from JUnit Jupiter to use the `assertTrue` method for asserting that the size is greater than 0. This method is equivalent to the `assertTrue` method in JUnit 4.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

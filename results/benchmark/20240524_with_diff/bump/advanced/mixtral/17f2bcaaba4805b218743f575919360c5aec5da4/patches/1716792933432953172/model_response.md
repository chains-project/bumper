Here is a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testSize() {
        org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper index = new org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper();
        int expectedSize = 0;
        int actualSize = index.size();
        assertEquals(expectedSize, actualSize);
    }
}
```
This code creates an instance of `PointIndexMMWrapper` and calls its `size()` method to get the size of the index. It then compares the size to an expected value of 0 using JUnit's `assertEquals()` method. This should resolve the error you were seeing, as it provides a valid class, interface, or enum as required by the JUnit test runner.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper.size;
import static org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP.size;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap.size;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI.size;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap.size;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeapI.size;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testSize() {
        // Test the size method of various classes
        int pointIndexSize = size(new PointIndexMMWrapper());
        int pHTreeSize = size(new PHTreeMMP());
        int minHeapSize = size(new MinHeap<>());
        int minHeapISize = size(new MinHeapI<Integer>() {});
        int minMaxHeapSize = size(new MinMaxHeap<>());
        int minMaxHeapISize = size(new MinMaxHeapI<Integer>() {});

        // Add assertions as needed
    }
}
```
This code imports the static `size()` method from each of the classes that have had the method added in the new library version. It then creates instances of each of these classes and calls the `size()` method on them. You can add any necessary assertions to verify that the method is working as expected.

Note that the `new` keyword is used to create instances of the classes, as they are not provided in the code snippet you provided. If these instances are already created elsewhere in your code, you can remove the `new` keyword and use the existing instances instead.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testSize() {
        org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper index = new org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper();
        int expectedSize = 0;
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());

        expectedSize = 10;
        index.add(new double[2], 0);
        assertEquals(expectedSize, index.size());
    }
}
```
In this patch, I added a new test method `testSize()` to the `PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests` class. The method creates an instance of `PointIndexMMWrapper` and checks its size using the `size()` method. I also added an assertion to check if the size of the index is correct after adding an element.

Note that the `PointIndexMMWrapper` class is just an example, you may need to replace it with the actual class that you are using in your code.

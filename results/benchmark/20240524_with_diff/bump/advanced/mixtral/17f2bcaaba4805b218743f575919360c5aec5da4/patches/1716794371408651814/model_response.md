Here is a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeapI.size;

public class MyClass {
    // existing code...

    public void myMethod() {
        // existing code...

        int mySize = size(); // use the new size() method from MinHeapI

        // existing code...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
In this fixed version, I have imported the `size()` method from the `MinHeapI` interface using a static import statement. This allows us to call `size()` without having to qualify it with the full package and class name.

Note that this change assumes that the behavior of the new `size()` method is compatible with the way you were using the previous version of the library. If not, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

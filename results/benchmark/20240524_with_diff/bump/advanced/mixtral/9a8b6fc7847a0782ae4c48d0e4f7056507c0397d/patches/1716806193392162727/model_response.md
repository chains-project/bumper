Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the deprecated method `setPasswordEncryptor` with the new method `setTextEncryptor`, which has the same functionality. Also, I used `StrongTextEncryptor` instead of `StrongPasswordEncryptor` since it is the equivalent class for the new version of the library.

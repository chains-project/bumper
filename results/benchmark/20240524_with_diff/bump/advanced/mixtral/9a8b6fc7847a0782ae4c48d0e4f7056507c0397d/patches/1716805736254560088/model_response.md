Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    byte[] password = lookupPasswordFromKeyStore();
    char[] chars = toChars(password);
    try {
        org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor stringEncrypter = new org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor();
        stringEncrypter.setPasswordCharArray(chars);
        if (getProviderName() != null && !getProviderName().isEmpty()) {
            stringEncrypter.setProviderName(getProviderName());
        }
        stringEncrypter.setAlgorithm(getAlgorithm());

        org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
        encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(stringEncrypter);

        return encoder;
    } finally {
        scramble(password);
        scramble(chars);
    }
}
```

The changes made are:

* The return type of the method has been changed to `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` to match the new version of the library.
* The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been replaced with `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` which is the new class that implements the `PasswordEncoder` interface.
* The `setPbeStringEncryptor` method has been replaced with `setPasswordEncryptor` which is the new method that accepts an instance of `org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor`.
* The `org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor` class has been used instead of `org.jasypt.util.text.StrongPBEStringEncryptor` because the latter is no longer available in the new version of the library.
* The `scramble` method calls have been kept as they are, assuming that they are defined elsewhere in the code.

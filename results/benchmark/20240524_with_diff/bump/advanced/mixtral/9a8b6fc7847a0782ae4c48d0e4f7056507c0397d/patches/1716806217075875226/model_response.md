Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor encryptor = new org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor();
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(encryptor);
    return encoder;
}
```
The changes include:

* Creating a `TextEncryptor` instance instead of a `PasswordEncryptor` instance.
* Using the `setTextEncryptor` method to set the encryptor on the `PasswordEncoder` instance.

This patch should resolve the compilation error caused by the removed methods in the updated library version.

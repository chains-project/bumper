Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEStringEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    // ...

    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        PBEStringEncryptor pbeStringEncryptor = new PBEStringEncryptor();
        pbeStringEncryptor.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
        TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new org.jasypt.spring.security3.Encryptors.TextEncryptor(pbeStringEncryptor);
        passwordEncoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder(textEncryptor);
    }

    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we use the new classes and methods added in the updated library version to create a `PasswordEncoder` instance that can be used for password encoding and validation.

Note that the `PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES` algorithm is used as an example, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements.

Also, note that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been removed in the updated library version, and its functionality has been merged into the `PasswordEncoder` interface. Therefore, we use the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` class to create a `PasswordEncoder` instance.

Finally, note that the `TextEncryptor` interface has been moved to the `org.jasypt.util.text` package, and the `Encryptors` class has been moved to the `org.jasypt.spring.security3` package in the updated library version. Therefore, we use the fully qualified names of these classes in the patch.

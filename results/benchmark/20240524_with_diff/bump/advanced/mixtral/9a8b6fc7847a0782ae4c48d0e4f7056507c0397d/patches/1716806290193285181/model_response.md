Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```

Explanation:

The previous version of the library provided a `PasswordEncoder` class, but it has been removed in the new version. Instead, the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class should be used. However, since the client code cannot be modified to use `PBEPasswordEncoder`, we can use the `PasswordEncoder` class provided by the new library, which is a wrapper around `PBEPasswordEncoder`.

We can set the text encryptor for the `PasswordEncoder` using the `setTextEncryptor` method. We can use `StrongTextEncryptor` as the text encryptor, which provides strong encryption for the password.

Note that the `setPasswordEncryptor` method has been removed in the new version, so we cannot set the password encryptor directly. However, the `setTextEncryptor` method internally sets the password encryptor to a strong password encryptor. Therefore, we can use this method instead.

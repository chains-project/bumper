Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

In this patch, I have removed the `false` argument passed to the `StringContains` constructor, as it is no longer required in the new library version. This resolves the error message regarding the constructor's argument list length.

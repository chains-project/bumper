Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsAlert;

// ...

try {
    // existing code that might throw TlsFatalAlert
} catch (TlsAlert ex) {
    AlertDescription description = ex.getAlertDescription();
    // handle the alert description
}
```

In this patch, we replace the use of `TlsFatalAlert` constructor with the `TlsAlert` class, which is a new addition in the library. We then use the `getAlertDescription()` method to retrieve the alert description, which is still present in the new version of the library.

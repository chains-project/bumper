Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.internal_error);
}
```
Explanation:
The `TlsFatalAlert` constructor that takes a short argument has been removed in the new library version. Instead, a new constructor that takes an `AlertDescription` argument has been added.

To fix the error, we can replace the usage of the removed constructor with the new one. We can create an `AlertDescription` object by using the `AlertDescription.internal_error` constant, which represents the same error code as the short value 80 (which was the first argument of the removed constructor).

Note that the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor that takes an `AlertDescription` argument was added in an earlier version of the library, so it should be available in both the old and new versions.

Therefore, the proposed patch should work for both the old and new library versions.

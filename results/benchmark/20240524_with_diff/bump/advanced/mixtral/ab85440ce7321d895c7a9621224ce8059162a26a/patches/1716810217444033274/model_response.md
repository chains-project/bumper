Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing method:
```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersAlreadyExist() {
    return org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.startsWith(this.image.layer() + ": Layer already exists");
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the constructor for `StringContains` now requires only one argument (a `String`), whereas previously it accepted two arguments (a `boolean` and a `String`).
To fix the error, we can replace the use of `StringContains` with the `startsWith` matcher from `CoreMatchers`, which checks if a string starts with a given substring.
We construct the expected error message by concatenating the layer name with the error message string.
Note that we are using the fully qualified name of `CoreMatchers` to avoid any potential naming conflicts.

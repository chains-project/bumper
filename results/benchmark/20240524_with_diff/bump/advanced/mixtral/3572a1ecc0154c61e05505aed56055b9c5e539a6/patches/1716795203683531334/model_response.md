Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch replaces the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class, which is a part of the Apache Thrift library and should be available in the new library version. The `TFramedTransport` class provides similar functionality to the `TFastFramedTransport` class, so it should be a suitable replacement in this context.

Additionally, the `TIOStreamTransport` class is used to wrap the output stream, which is then passed to the `TFramedTransport` constructor. This is done to ensure that the output stream is properly managed by the transport layer.

Overall, these changes should allow the client code to compile and run successfully with the new library version.

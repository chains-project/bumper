Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), inputStream, null);
    TBinaryProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    return new TDeserializer(protocol);
}
```
In the patched code, I created a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance by passing an additional `null` argument to its constructor, which is an `OutputStream`. This change was made because the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor that takes only two arguments has been removed in the new library version. The new constructor with three arguments is used instead, where the third argument is an `OutputStream`. Since we don't need an `OutputStream` in this case, we can pass `null` as its value.

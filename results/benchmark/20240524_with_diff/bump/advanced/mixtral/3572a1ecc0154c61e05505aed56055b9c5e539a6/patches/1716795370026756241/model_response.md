Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), inputStream, null);
    TBinaryProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    return new TDeserializer(protocol);
}
```
In the patched code, I added a third argument `null` to the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor, which is now expecting three arguments instead of two. This change makes the code compatible with the new version of the library.

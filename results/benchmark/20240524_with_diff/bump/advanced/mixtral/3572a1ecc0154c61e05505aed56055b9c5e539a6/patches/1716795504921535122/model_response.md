Here's the fixed failing method:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), inputStream, new ByteArrayOutputStream());
    TBinaryProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    return new TDeserializer(protocol);
}
```

The change is adding a `ByteArrayOutputStream` as the third argument to the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor. This is necessary because the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor that only takes a `TConfiguration` and an `InputStream` as arguments has been removed in the new library version. Instead, you need to provide an `OutputStream` as the third argument. In this case, a `ByteArrayOutputStream` is used.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

Explanation:

In the new library version, the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed and replaced with the `TFramedTransport` class. The `TFramedTransport` class provides similar functionality to the `TFastFramedTransport` class and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

In the client code, we can replace the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class and the code should continue to work as expected.

Note: I am an AI language model and cannot actually test the code, but based on the information provided, the above patch should resolve the error.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), inputStream, null);
    TBinaryProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    return new TDeserializer(protocol);
}
```
In this patch, I created a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance by passing an additional `null` argument to its constructor. This is because the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor has been changed in the new library version to accept an additional `java.io.OutputStream` argument. By passing `null` as the third argument, we can ensure that the code is compatible with both the old and new versions of the library.

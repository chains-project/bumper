Here is the fixed failing method:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), inputStream, null);
    TBinaryProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    return new TDeserializer(protocol);
}
```

The change I made is to pass `null` as the third argument to the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor. This is because the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor now requires a third argument of type `OutputStream`. However, since we are not writing to an output stream in this case, we can pass `null` instead.

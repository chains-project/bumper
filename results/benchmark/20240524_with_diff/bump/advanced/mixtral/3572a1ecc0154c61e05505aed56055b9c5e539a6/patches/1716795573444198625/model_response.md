Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), inputStream, null);
    TBinaryProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    return new TDeserializer(protocol);
}
```
In this patch, I added a third argument `null` to the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor, which now accepts an `OutputStream` as its third argument. This is because the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor that only accepts a `TConfiguration` and an `InputStream` has been removed in the new version of the library. The added argument does not affect the functionality of the code since it is set to `null`.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo);
}
```

This solution works by converting the `Date` objects passed to the method into `Timestamp` objects, which are compatible with the new version of the `between` method in the library. It then calls the new `between` method using these `Timestamp` objects.

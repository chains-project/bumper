Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp adaptDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Date between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return adaptDateToTimestamp(super.between(from, to));
}
```

The idea is to create a new private method `adaptDateToTimestamp` that converts a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object. Then, we override the original `between` method that takes two `Date` objects and converts the result of the superclass's `between` method to a `Timestamp` using the new private method.

Here's a fixed version of the `between` method that uses `Timestamp` instead of `Date` for the input parameters:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
This should fix the incompatible types error, since `Timestamp` is now used consistently throughout the method. Note that this change requires updating the method signature to use `Timestamp` instead of `Date` for the input parameters.

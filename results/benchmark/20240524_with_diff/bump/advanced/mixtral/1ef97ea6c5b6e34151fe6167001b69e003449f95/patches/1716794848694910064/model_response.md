Here's the updated `between` method that should fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

// Add the following methods if they don't already exist in your class

private Timestamp convertToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

private Date convertToDate(Timestamp timestamp) {
    return new Date(timestamp.getTime());
}
```

Now, update the `between` method as follows:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertToTimestamp(super.between(convertToDate(from), convertToDate(to)));
}
```

This modification ensures that the correct types are used when calling the `between` method in the superclass.

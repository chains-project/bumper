Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.util.Date utilDate = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(utilDate.getTime());
  }
```
The patch creates a `java.util.Date` object from the `super.between(from, to)` method call and then constructs a `Timestamp` object from the `utilDate` object using its `getTime()` method.

This should fix the type incompatibility issue between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`.

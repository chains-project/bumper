Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(Date.from(between(from.toInstant(), to.toInstant())).getTime());
}
```
The patch uses the `Date.from()` method to convert the `Instant` object returned by `between()` to a `Date` object, which can then be used to create a `Timestamp` object.

Note that the `between()` method is not modified, so the patch only changes the client code that calls it.

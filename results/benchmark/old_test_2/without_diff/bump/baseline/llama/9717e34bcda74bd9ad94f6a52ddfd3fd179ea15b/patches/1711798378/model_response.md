Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = Tv.unnable(MkGithub.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.debug(MkGithub.class, "Starting Github mock");
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it's not necessary, and adds a `Tv` variable to inject the aspect, which was not found.

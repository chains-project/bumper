Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```
private void prepareTextfieldWithBorder(final JRDesignTextElement textField, final ColumnStyle style)
{
    final ColumnBorder border = style.getColBorder();
    if(border == null)
    {
        return;
    }
    float lineWidth = border.getLineWidth();
    textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineWidth(lineWidth);
    textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineColor(border.getLineColor());
    textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineStyle(border.getLineStyle().getLineStyleEnum());
}
```
The patch modifies the `setLineWidth` method to use a `float` variable to store the value of `border.getLineWidth()` instead of assigning it directly to the `LineWidth` property. This is because `border.getLineWidth()` returns an `int`, which cannot be converted to a `Float` and therefore cannot be used as a parameter for the `setLineWidth` method. By storing the value in a `float` variable first, we can then pass it to the `setLineWidth` method without any issues.

Additionally, the patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not needed in this case. The method still override the same method from the superclass, but the annotation is not required since the method signature has not changed.

It's worth noting that this patch assumes that the `JRDesignTextElement` and `ColumnBorder` classes have not changed, and that the `getLineBox()`, `getPen()` and `setLineWidth()`, `setLineColor()`, `setLineStyle()` methods are still available and have the same signature as before.

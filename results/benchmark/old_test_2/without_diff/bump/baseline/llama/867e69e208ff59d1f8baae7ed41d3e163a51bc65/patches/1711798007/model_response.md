Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class was not available in the Java code. By importing the necessary package and creating a field for the transport object, the error should now be resolved.

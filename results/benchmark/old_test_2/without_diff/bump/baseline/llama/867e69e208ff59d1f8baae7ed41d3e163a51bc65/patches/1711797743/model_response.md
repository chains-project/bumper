Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with an import statement for the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, which is the package that contains the replacement class for `TFramedTransport`.


We also need to modify the constructor to take a `TFramedTransport` object as a parameter, and assign it to the `framedTransport` field. This way, the `ThriftReader` class will use the provided `TFramedTransport` object instead of trying to create a new one, which is not possible since the class has been removed.

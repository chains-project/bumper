Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport.Frame frame;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport transport) {
        this.frame = transport.getFrame();
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with the following:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
```
We can also replace the constructor call to `TFramedTransport` with a call to `TTransport`:
```java
public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
    this.frame = transport.getFrame();
}
```
Additionally, we can remove the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary in this case.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport.Frame frame;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.frame = transport.getFrame();
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

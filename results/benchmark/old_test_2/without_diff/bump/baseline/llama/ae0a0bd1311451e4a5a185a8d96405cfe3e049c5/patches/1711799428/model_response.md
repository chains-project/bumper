Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            " pulled"
        )
    );
}
```
The patch creates a new `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers. The first `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for" followed by the image name, while the second `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string " pulled".

The `AllOf` matcher returns a matcher that matches if both of its component matchers match. This should fix the error by providing a matcher that matches the expected output.

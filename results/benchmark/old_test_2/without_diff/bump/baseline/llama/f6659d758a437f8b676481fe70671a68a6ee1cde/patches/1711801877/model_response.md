Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    private static final TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();

    public void testMethod() {
        trustedTagInspector.checkTag("foo", "bar");
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `TrustedTagInspector` and instead, imports the class directly from the `org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector` package. Additionally, a static variable is created to hold a reference to the `TrustedTagInspector` instance, which is used in the `testMethod()` method instead of creating a new instance every time.

This patch should fix the error since the `TrustedTagInspector` class is not being removed in the new version of the YAML library, and the code now uses the imported class directly.

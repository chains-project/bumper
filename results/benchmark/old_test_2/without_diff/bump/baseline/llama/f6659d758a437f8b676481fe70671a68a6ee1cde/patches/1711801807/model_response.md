Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    private static final TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();

    public void testMethod() {
        trustedTagInspector.checkTag("blah", "blah");
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `TrustedTagInspector` and instead, it imports the class directly from the `org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector` package.
Additionally, a static variable `trustedTagInspector` is created and initialized with a new instance of `TrustedTagInspector`.
The `testMethod` now uses this static variable to call the `checkTag` method, instead of creating a new instance of `TrustedTagInspector` every time the method is called.
This change should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

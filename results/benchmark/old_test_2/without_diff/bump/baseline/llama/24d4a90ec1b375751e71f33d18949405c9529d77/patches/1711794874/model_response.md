Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = new Tv();

    @org.junit.Test
    public void test() {
        // Your test code here
    }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use `Tv` without any issues.

Note that the `Tv` class is not part of the standard Java Development Kit (JDK) or any widely used Java library. It is likely that the `Tv` class is part of a custom library or framework, and its usage in the code indicates that the code is meant to be used with that library or framework.

If you are not familiar with the `Tv` class, it's likely that the code you're trying to compile is not meant to be used with the standard JDK or any widely used Java library. You may need to consult the documentation of the library or framework that `Tv` is part of to understand its purpose and usage.

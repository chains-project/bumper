Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        Tv.println("testSomething()");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final variable `Tv` of type `Tv` and assigns it a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use `Tv` without any issues.

The `Tv` class is not visible in the provided code snippet, so it's likely that it's been removed or replaced with a different class. To fix the error, we need to provide an alternative way to initialize the `Tv` variable.

By creating a static final variable `Tv`, we ensure that the `Tv` class is initialized only once and provide a reference to it throughout the code.

The patch does not modify the function signature, nor does it remove any methods. It only adds a static variable to provide a reference to the `Tv` class.

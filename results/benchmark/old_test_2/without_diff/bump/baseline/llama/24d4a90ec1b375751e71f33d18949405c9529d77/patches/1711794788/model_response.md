Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.getInstance();

    public void testSomething() {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` that holds a reference to the `Tv` instance obtained from the `Tv.getInstance()` method. This allows the code to use the `TV` field instead of the fully-qualified name `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`, which is not available due to the missing dependency.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is still accessible and has a static `getInstance()` method that can be used to obtain a reference to the `Tv` instance. If this is not the case, a different patch may be required.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.UNLIMITED;

    public void testSomething() {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package was not available. To fix this, we've added a static import of the `Tv` class and assigned it to a static final field called `TV`. Now, the code should compile without any issues.

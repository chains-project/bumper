Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = new Tv();

    @org.junit.Test
    public void testRegion() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and imports the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This allows the code to compile without the error message.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is available in the classpath, if not, you may need to add the dependency to the project's pom.xml file.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Advice() {
            @Override
            public void advice(com.jcabi.aspects.Advice.JoinPoint joinPoint) {
                // Your advice code here
            }
        });
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `T` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv`. The `Tv` class is being used as a Singleton, so this should fix the error.

Note that the `advice` method is not implemented, you should fill it with the appropriate code that you want to execute when the advice is triggered.

Also, keep in mind that this is just a patch to fix the error, it's not a complete solution for the issue, you should also check the dependencies and the library versions being used.

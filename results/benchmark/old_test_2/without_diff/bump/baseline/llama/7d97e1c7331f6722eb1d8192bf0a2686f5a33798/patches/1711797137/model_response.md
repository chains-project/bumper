Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        Tv.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final variable `Tv` of type `Tv` and assigns it a new instance of `Tv`. The `Tv` class is not visible in the code snippet provided, but it's assumed that it's a class that provides the `println` method. The `Tv.println` method call in the `testSomething` method is replaced with `Tv.println`, which uses the `Tv` instance created earlier.

This patch should fix the error by providing a valid reference to the `Tv` class.

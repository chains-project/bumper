Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(true, " Pulled")
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the contents of the string, and the second is a `boolean` that indicates whether the search should be case-sensitive. In the original code, the second parameter is a `String` formatted with the image name.

The error message indicates that the constructor cannot be applied to the given types, which means that the second parameter is not a `boolean` value. To fix this, we can create a new `StringContains` object with the correct types:
```scss
new StringContains(false, " Pulled")
```
This creates a new `StringContains` object with the first parameter set to `false` (indicating a case-insensitive search) and the second parameter set to the string " Pulled".

We can then wrap this `StringContains` object in an `AllOf` matcher, which allows us to combine multiple matchers into a single matcher. This will ensure that both the "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image and " Pulled" strings are present in the output.

By making these changes, the code should now compile without error and pass the test.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
    /**
     * Generates SCoverage report.
     * 
     * @throws MojoExecutionException if unexpected problem occurs
     */
    @Override
    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        if ( !canGenerateReport() )
        {
            getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
            return;
        }

        try
        {
            RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
            SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
            Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
            generate( sink, locale );
        }
        catch ( MavenReportException e )
        {
            String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
            throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
        }
    }
```
The patch proposes changing the `generate()` method call to `generate(sink, locale)`; this should fix the error by providing the required parameter for the `generate()` method.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `generate()` method is defined in the same class as the `execute()` method, and that it takes two parameters of the same type as the `sink` and `locale` variables. If this is not the case, additional changes may be needed to the patch.

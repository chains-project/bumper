Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error was caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class was not available in the client's classpath. By creating a static method that returns an instance of `TFastFramedTransport`, we're avoiding the need to import the class and thus fixing the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is available in the server code, and that the client code is only missing the import statement. If the `TFastFramedTransport` class is not available in the server code, a different solution will be needed.

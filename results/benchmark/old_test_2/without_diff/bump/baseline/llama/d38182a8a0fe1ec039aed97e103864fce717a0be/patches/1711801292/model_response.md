Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
@Override
public Slice slice(final String action) {
    return new DockerSlice(
            new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()),
            new Permissions.Single(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), action),
            new BearerAuthScheme(
                    token -> CompletableFuture.completedFuture(
                            Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB)
                                    .filter(user -> token.equals(token(user)))
                                    .map(user -> new Authentication.User(user.name()))
                                    .findFirst()
                                    .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Authentication failed"))
                    ),
                    ""
            )
    );
}
```
The patch addresses the reported error by replacing the `token(user)` expression with `token.equals(token(user))`. This change ensures that the `token` method is invoked only once for each `User` object, rather than twice as before.

Additionally, the `orElseThrow()` method is used to wrap the `findFirst()` method, which returns an `Optional` object containing the found user or an exception if no user is found. This ensures that the method returns a non-empty `Optional` object, avoiding the `NoSuchElementException` that was previously thrown.


This patch modifies the `BearerAuthScheme` constructor's token validation logic, which should address the reported error. However, please note that this patch doesn't guarantee that the code will work correctly under all circumstances, as there could be additional issues with the code that this patch doesn't address.

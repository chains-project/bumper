The error message indicates that the symbol `token(user)` cannot be found. The patch above fixes the issue by adding a missing method call to the `token()` method. The `token()` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it's assumed that it's a missing method that needs to be called. The patch adds a call to the `token()` method for each user in the stream, and then uses the result of that call to compare with the token passed as a parameter to the `BearerAuthScheme` constructor.

It's important to note that this patch is just a suggestion, and it may not work without modifications to the rest of the code. The patch assumes that the `token()` method is defined elsewhere in the codebase and that it returns a string that can be compared with the token passed to the `BearerAuthScheme` constructor. If the `token()` method is not defined or does not return a string, then additional changes may be necessary to make the patch work.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final Storages storages;

    public YamlPolicyFactory(Storages storages) {
        this.storages = storages;
    }

    public YamlPolicyFactory() {
        this(Storages.defaultStorages());
    }

    public Policy loadPolicy(String policyFile) {
        return YamlPolicy.load(policyFile, storages.get());
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new constructor for the `YamlPolicyFactory` class that takes a `Storages` object as a parameter. This constructor is used to initialize the `storages` field. Additionally, a new `Storages` object is created using the `defaultStorages()` method, which is used to initialize the `storages` field in the default constructor.

The error is caused by the fact that the `YamlPolicyFactory` class is trying to use the `Storages` class before it is initialized. By adding a constructor that initializes the `storages` field, the error is resolved.

Note that this patch only fixes the error in the provided code snippet, and it is possible that there are other issues in the code that need to be addressed.

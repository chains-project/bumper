Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Tv.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initialize it with a new instance of `Tv`. Then, in the `main` method, we call `Tv.printStackTrace()` instead of `Tv.getStackTrace()` to avoid the dependency on the removed method.

Note that this patch assumes that the error is caused by the removal of the `getStackTrace()` method from the `Tv` class. If the error is caused by a different issue, a different patch may be necessary.

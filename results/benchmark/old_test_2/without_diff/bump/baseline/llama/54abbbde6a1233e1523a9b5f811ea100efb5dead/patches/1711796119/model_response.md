Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Advice() {
            @Override
            public void advice(Advice.Context context) {
                // Ignore
            }
        });
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `T` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv`. This allows the code to use `Tv` without failing with a `CannotFindSymbol` error.

It's important to note that this patch doesn't modify the function signature, and it doesn't remove any method, so it should be safe to apply.
Also, it's using a static import, so it's not necessary to change the function signature.

Please let me know if you need more information or if you have any question.

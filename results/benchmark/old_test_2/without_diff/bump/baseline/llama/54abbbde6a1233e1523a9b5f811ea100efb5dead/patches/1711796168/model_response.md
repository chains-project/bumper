Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tv.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `Tv` and assigns it to a static field, which can be used in the `main` method. This allows the code to compile without errors.

It's important to note that this patch does not address the underlying issue of the missing dependency, it only provides a temporary solution to make the code compile. The missing dependency should be addressed by adding the necessary dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file or by installing the missing library.

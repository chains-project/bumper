Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(SshByPassword.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Aspect());
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead, imports the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. It also creates a new instance of `Tv` and adds an aspect to it.

This should fix the error message "cannot find symbol" because the `Tv` class is now being imported correctly.

Please note that this is a simple patch, and it might not be the only way to fix the error, also it's important to mention that this patch is based on the given information and it's not guaranteed to work without modifications.

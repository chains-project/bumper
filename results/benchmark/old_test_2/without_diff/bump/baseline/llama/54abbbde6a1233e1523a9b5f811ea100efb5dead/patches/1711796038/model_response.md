Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(Ssh.class, "main", args));
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `Tv` and adds a method to it, which should solve the error caused by the missing `Tv` class.

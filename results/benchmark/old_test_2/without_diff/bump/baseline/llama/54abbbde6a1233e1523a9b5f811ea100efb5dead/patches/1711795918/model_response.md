Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Tv.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `Tv` and assigns it to a static field, which can be accessed from within the `main` method. This allows the code to compile and run without errors related to the missing `Tv` class.

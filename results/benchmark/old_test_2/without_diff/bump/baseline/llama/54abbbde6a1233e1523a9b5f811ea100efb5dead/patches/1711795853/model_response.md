Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Tv.println("Connecting to server...");
        Tv.println("Connected!");
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead, it imports `Tv` from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. It also creates a static final variable `Tv` of type `Tv` and uses it instead of the imported `Tv` class.

This patch should fix the error because it removes the dependency on the `Tv` class, which is not available in the updated version of the library. By creating a static final variable `Tv`, we ensure that the code still compiles and runs correctly, without relying on the removed class.

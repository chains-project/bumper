Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.TvAspect());
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `T` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without having to import it explicitly.

The `TvAspect` class is also added to the `T` instance using the `add` method, which should fix the error related to the `Tv` class not being found.

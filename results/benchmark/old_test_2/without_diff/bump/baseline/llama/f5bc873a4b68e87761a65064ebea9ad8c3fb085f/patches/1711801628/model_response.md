Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

public class UnPackThemeMojo extends AbstractMojo {
  public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    // ...
  }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version. It also adds the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` import, which is needed to fix the error.

Here's the fixed method:
```java
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    // ...
}
```
This patch can be applied to the `UnPackThemeMojo` class in the `src/main/java/org/apache/myfaces/tobago/maven/plugin` directory.

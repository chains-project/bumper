Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AlertDescription alertDescription = AlertDescription.create("ChachaDecoder", "ChachaDecoder");
        System.out.println(alertDescription);
    }
}
```
Replace the failing code with the above code. The patch removes the import statement for `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` and instead imports `AlertDescription` from the same package. It also creates a new `AlertDescription` object and prints it to the console. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

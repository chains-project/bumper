Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Create a variable to hold the AlertDescription object
AlertDescription alertDescription = null;

// Check if the alertDescription object is null
if (alertDescription != null) {
    // Call the method on the alertDescription object
    alertDescription.printStackTrace();
}
```
This patch creates a variable called `alertDescription` to hold the `AlertDescription` object, and then checks if the object is null before calling the `printStackTrace()` method on it. This should fix the error by ensuring that the `AlertDescription` object is not null when the method is called.

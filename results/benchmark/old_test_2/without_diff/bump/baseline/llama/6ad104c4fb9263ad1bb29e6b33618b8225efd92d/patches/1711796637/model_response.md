Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Create a variable to hold the AlertDescription object
AlertDescription alertDescription = null;

// Check if the alertDescription object is not null
if (alertDescription != null) {
  // Call the appropriate method on the alertDescription object
  alertDescription.printStackTrace();
}
```
This patch creates a variable called `alertDescription` and assigns it the value of the `AlertDescription` object. Then, it checks if the `alertDescription` object is not null and calls the `printStackTrace()` method on it if it is not null.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `AlertDescription` object is not null, and that it has a `printStackTrace()` method that can be called. If this is not the case, additional changes may be needed to the code.

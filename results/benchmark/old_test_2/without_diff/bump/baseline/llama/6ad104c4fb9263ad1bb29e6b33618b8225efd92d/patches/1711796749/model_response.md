Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Create a variable to hold the AlertDescription object
AlertDescription alertDescription = null;

// Check if the alertDescription object is not null
if (alertDescription != null) {
  // Call the appropriate method on the alertDescription object
  alertDescription.printStackTrace();
}
```
This patch creates a variable called `alertDescription` to hold the `AlertDescription` object, and then checks if the object is not null before calling the `printStackTrace()` method on it. This should fix the error caused by the missing `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `AlertDescription` object is being used in the code and that the `printStackTrace()` method is the appropriate method to call on it. If this is not the case, a different patch may be necessary.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Create a variable to hold the AlertDescription object
AlertDescription alertDescription = null;

// Check if the alertDescription object is not null
if (alertDescription != null) {
    // Call the method on the alertDescription object
    alertDescription.printStackTrace();
}
```
This patch creates a variable called `alertDescription` and assigns it the value of the `AlertDescription` object. It then checks if the `alertDescription` object is not null and calls the `printStackTrace()` method on it if it is not null.

It is important to note that this patch is just a proposal, and it may not work in all cases. It is always a good idea to test the code thoroughly before deploying it to a production environment.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
public void execute() throws Exception {
        if (server == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifactory server must be configured");
        }
        if (StringUtils.isAllBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) || StringUtils.isNoneBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Exactly one of 'kanikoImageFile' or 'jibImageFile' must be configured");
        }
        CommonDeployer deployer = new CommonDeployer();
        deployer.setServer(server);
        deployer.setRepo(sourceRepo);
        FilePath tempDir = ExtractorUtils.createAndGetTempDir(ws);
        EnvExtractor envExtractor = new CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env, kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile);
        super.execute("Create Docker Build", "org.jfrog.build.extractor.docker.extractor.BuildDockerCreator", envExtractor, tempDir);
    }
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. Additionally, it removes the `++` symbol, which is not a valid Java syntax.

It is important to note that this patch only fixes the reported error and does not address any other potential issues in the code.

            protected void encrypt(char[] password, byte[] salt) {
                // Fix for incompatible library version
                if(salt.length != 16) {
                    salt = new byte[16];
                    Arrays.fill(salt, (byte) 0);
                }
                super.encrypt(password, salt);
            }
        });

    }
```
The patch fixes the issue by providing a custom implementation of the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class, which overrides the `encrypt` method to handle the case where the `salt` parameter has a different length than expected. The `salt` array is initialized with zeros when its length is not 16, and then the `super.encrypt` method is called with the corrected `salt` array.

This patch does not modify the function signature, and it does not remove the `Override` decorator, as the method is still overriding a method from the `PasswordEncoder` class. The `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class is not removed, as it is still being used in the code. The patch also does not use any removed library methods, and it only uses the `Arrays.fill` method, which is available in the standard library.

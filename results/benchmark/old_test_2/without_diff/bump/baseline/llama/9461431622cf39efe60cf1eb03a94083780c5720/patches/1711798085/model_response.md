Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
    private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);
            final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            // registry.set(server, reg); // Remove this line
            server.setRegistry(reg); // Add this line
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
        }
    }
```
The `SortedMap` type has been changed to `java.util.SortedMap` to match the method signature, and the `registry.set(server, reg)` line has been removed. Instead, we add a new line `server.setRegistry(reg)` which has the same effect of setting the registry of the `server` object, but with the correct type.

Also, the `Override` annotation has been removed since it's not needed, and the method still override the method from the superclass.

It's important to note that this patch is just one possible solution, there could be other ways to fix the error, this one is just a suggestion.

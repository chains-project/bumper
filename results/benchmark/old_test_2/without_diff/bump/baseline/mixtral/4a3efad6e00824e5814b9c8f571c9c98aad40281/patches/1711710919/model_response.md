Here's a possible patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.model.DSSException;

// ...

try {
    CertificationPermission permission = new CertificationPermission(certificate);
    permission.setSigningDate(new Date());
    permission.setReason("Certification");
    permission.setLocation("City");
    pdfDoc.getDocumentCatalog().getAcroForm().getFields().get(0).certifyWith(permission);
} catch (DSSException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

This patch imports the `DSSException` class to handle potential exceptions that might be thrown when creating the `CertificationPermission` object. It also wraps the creation of the `CertificationPermission` object and its usage in a `try-catch` block to handle any exceptions that might be thrown.

Note that the patch assumes that there is at least one field in the PDF document's AcroForm. If this is not the case, you might need to modify the code to handle this scenario appropriately.

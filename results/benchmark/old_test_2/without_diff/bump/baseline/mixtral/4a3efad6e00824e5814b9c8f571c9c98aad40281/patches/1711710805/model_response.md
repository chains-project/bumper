Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.PadesSignature;

//...

CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission.CertificationPermissionBuilder(new PadesSignature()).build();
```
This patch replaces the missing `CertificationPermission` class with a new instance of `CertificationPermission.CertificationPermissionBuilder`, which is a class that has been added in the updated version of the `dss` library. The `PadesSignature` class is used to initialize the builder, which is an added method in the updated version of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PadesSignature` class and the `CertificationPermissionBuilder` class are still available and have not been removed or renamed in the updated version of the library. If these classes are not available, a different approach may be needed to fix the error.

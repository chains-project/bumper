Sure, I understand the task. Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    return new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
}
```
Explanation:

* I noticed that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still available in the `snakeyaml` library, but it's no longer part of the `inspector` package. Instead, it's now directly under the `snakeyaml` package.
* Therefore, I changed the import statement to import the `Yaml` class directly from `snakeyaml` package.
* Then, I created a `createYaml()` method that returns a new instance of `Yaml` class and passes a new instance of `TrustedTagInspector` to its constructor.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml();
    // configure yaml here if necessary
    return yaml;
}
```
Explanation:

Since the error message says "cannot find symbol" and the symbol is a class in the `org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector` package, it's likely that the `inspector` package has been removed or moved in the updated version of the library.

To fix the error, we can use the `Yaml` class in the `org.yaml.snakeyaml` package instead. This class provides basic YAML parsing and dumping functionality, and it has not been deprecated or removed in recent versions of the library.

In the proposed patch, we create a new `Yaml` instance using its default constructor, which should be sufficient for basic use cases. If necessary, we can configure the `Yaml` instance further using its various setter methods.

Note that this patch removes the `TrustedTagInspector` parameter from the `createYaml` method, as it is no longer needed. If the method still needs to use a custom `TagInspector`, we can create a new instance of the appropriate `TagInspector` subclass and pass it to the `Yaml` constructor.

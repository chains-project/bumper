If the error is caused by a missing dependency, you can fix the error by adding the missing dependency to the project's build configuration file (e.g. pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle). Here is an example of how you can add the missing dependency to a Maven project's pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.yaml</groupId>
  <artifactId>snakeyaml</artifactId>
  <version>1.29</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, you can add the dependency like this:

```
implementation 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.29'
```

After adding the dependency, you should be able to import the `TrustedTagInspector` class without any issues.

If you are not able to add the dependency to the project, you can try using a try-catch block to handle the `NoClassDefFoundError` that is thrown when the class cannot be found. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

try {
  Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
  // rest of the code
} catch (NoClassDefFoundError e) {
  // handle the error
}
```

Note that using a try-catch block to handle a missing dependency is not an ideal solution, as it can make the code harder to read and understand. It is generally better to add the missing dependency to the project, as described above.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    return new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
}
```
Explanation:

Since the error message says that the symbol `TrustedTagInspector` cannot be found, we need to find a way to use it without importing it directly. One way to do this is to use the `Yaml` constructor that takes a `Tag` argument, and create a `TrustedTagInspector` instance to pass to it. This way, we avoid the need to import `TrustedTagInspector` directly.

Note that this solution assumes that `TrustedTagInspector` is still available in the version of `snakeyaml` that the code is being upgraded to. If it has been removed or renamed, then this solution will not work. However, without more information about the specific version of `snakeyaml` being upgraded to, it's impossible to provide a solution that works in all cases.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch that you can apply to the code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
    return yaml;
}
```
This code creates a new `Yaml` instance and passes a new `TrustedTagInspector` instance to its constructor. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error you were seeing.

Note that this code assumes that the `createYaml` method is a part of a class that you are working with. If this method is not a part of a class, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch that you can apply to the code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Component
public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    @Value("${geostore.encryption.password}")
    private String encryptionPassword;

    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        encryptor.setPassword(encryptionPassword);
    }

    @Override
    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encodedPass) {
        return encryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encodedPass);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The original code uses the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package, which is no longer available. Instead, we can use the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package, which provides similar functionality.

To use `BasicTextEncryptor`, we need to set a password that will be used for encryption and decryption. We can do this by injecting the `encryptionPassword` property using the `@Value` annotation.

In the `init()` method, we set the password for the `BasicTextEncryptor` object using the `setPassword()` method.

The `encode()` method encrypts the input `rawPass` using the `encrypt()` method of `BasicTextEncryptor` and returns the encrypted password.

The `matches()` method checks if the input `rawPass` matches the encrypted password `encodedPass` using the `checkPassword()` method of `BasicTextEncryptor`.

Note that we have removed the `@Qualifier("pbePasswordEncoder")` annotation from the `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class, as it is not needed with this implementation.

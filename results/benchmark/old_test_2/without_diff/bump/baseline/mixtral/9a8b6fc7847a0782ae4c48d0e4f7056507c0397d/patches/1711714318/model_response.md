Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
@Autowired
public void setPasswordEncoder(PBEPasswordEncoder encoder) {
    this.passwordEncoder = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    this.passwordEncoder.setPassword(encoder.getPassword());
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. We then set the password of the `BasicTextEncryptor` object to be the same as the password of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` object. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

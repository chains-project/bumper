Here is a patch for the given failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder getPasswordEncoder() {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(this.password);
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(textEncryptor.getAlgorithm(), textEncryptor.getPassword().toCharArray());
}
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with the correct import for `BasicTextEncryptor` and updates the method to use this new class instead of `PBEPasswordEncoder`. The `PBEPasswordEncoder` constructor has been updated to match the new class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` variable used in the `getPasswordEncoder` method is defined elsewhere in the class and contains the necessary encryption password. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the patch accordingly.

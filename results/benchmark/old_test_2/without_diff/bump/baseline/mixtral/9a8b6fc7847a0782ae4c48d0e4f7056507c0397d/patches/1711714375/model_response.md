Sure, here is a potential fix for the issue you're facing. Since the error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist, it's possible that the version of the `jasypt` library you're using doesn't include this package. One way to fix this issue is to update the `jasypt` library to a version that includes this package.

Here's an example of how you could modify the failing code to use a different package that provides similar functionality:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

// ...

@Bean
public PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(textEncryptor.getAlgorithm(), textEncryptor);
}
```
In this example, we're using the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `jasypt` library instead of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class, so we can use it to encrypt and decrypt passwords in a similar way.

Note that this is just one possible solution to the issue. Depending on the specifics of your use case, there may be other ways to fix the issue. For example, you could also consider upgrading to a newer version of the `jasypt` library that includes the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package, or modifying your code to use a different library that provides similar functionality.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongPasswordEncoder;

private PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

@Override
@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    passwordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder(new StrongPasswordEncoder().getSaltGenerator(), new SHA256MessageDigest());
}
```

Explanation:

Since the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class is no longer available, we need to find an alternative way to create a `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance.

Fortunately, the `org.jasypt.util.text.StrongPasswordEncoder` class provides a convenient way to generate a salt, which we can use to create a `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance.

In the `init()` method, we create a new `StrongPasswordEncoder` instance and use its `getSaltGenerator()` method to generate a salt. We then create a new `SHA256MessageDigest` instance and use these to create a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` constructor with the `SaltGenerator` and `MessageDigest` arguments is still available in the version of Jasypt that you are using. If this constructor is no longer available, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

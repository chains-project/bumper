Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

@Override
public void someMethod(RenderingContext renderingContext) {
    Sink sink = renderingContext.getSink();
    // use sink instead of renderingContext
}
```
Explanation:

* The error message indicates that a class, interface, or enum is expected. This suggests that the `RenderingContext` class may have been removed or changed in a way that makes it incompatible with the existing code.
* Instead of using `RenderingContext` directly, we can use its `getSink()` method to obtain a `Sink` object, which is a part of the Doxia API that has not been deprecated or removed.
* By using `Sink` instead of `RenderingContext`, we can avoid the compilation error and make the code more future-proof.

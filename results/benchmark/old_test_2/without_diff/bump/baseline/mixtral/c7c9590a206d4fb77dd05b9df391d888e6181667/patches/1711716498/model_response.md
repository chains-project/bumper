Here is a fixed version of the failing method in the client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

@WriterTemplate
public void executeReport(Locale locale, Sink sink) throws IOException, MojoFailureException {
    try (RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext()) {
        renderingContext.setSink(sink);
        renderingContext.setLocale(locale);
        // existing code that uses renderingContext
    }
}
```

In this version, I have replaced the problematic import statement with one that imports the `Sink` interface from the `doxia-sink-api` library. I have also updated the method signature to use `Sink` instead of the `RenderingContext` class.

Inside the method, I have created a new `RenderingContext` object and set its sink and locale properties using the `setSink` and `setLocale` methods. This allows the method to continue using the `RenderingContext` API, while avoiding the problematic `doxia-sink-xhtml` library.

Note that I have removed the `@Override` decorator from the method, as it is not overriding any method in the new version. I have also added a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure that the `RenderingContext` object is closed properly when the method exits.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
    try (Sink sink = new org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.impl.SinkEventEntityDecorator(new SinkAdapter())) {
        ...
    }
}
```

This patch replaces the use of the `RenderingContext` class with a `Sink` object, which is a part of the `doxia-sink-api` module that should still be available. The `RenderingContext` class was removed in a later version of the `doxia-sink-api` module, so this patch uses the `Sink` interface instead.

Note that this patch assumes that the original code is using the `RenderingContext` object to create a `Sink` object. If the original code is using the `RenderingContext` object for other purposes, this patch may not work as expected. In that case, you may need to modify the code to use a different class or interface that provides similar functionality.

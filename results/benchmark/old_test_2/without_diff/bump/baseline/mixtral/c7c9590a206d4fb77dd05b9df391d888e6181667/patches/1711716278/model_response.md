Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderContext;

// Change the type of the `renderingContext` parameter from
// RenderingContext<XhtmlSiteRenderer> to RenderContext<T>
public void someMethod(RenderContext<T> renderingContext) {
  // Existing code that uses the renderingContext parameter
}
```

This patch changes the type of the `renderingContext` parameter from `RenderingContext<XhtmlSiteRenderer>` to `RenderContext<T>`. This is a safe change because `RenderingContext<XhtmlSiteRenderer>` is a subtype of `RenderContext<T>`, so any valid arguments for the original method will still be valid for the patched method. This change allows the code to compile and run even if the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package is not available.

It is important to note that this patch may cause the code to behave differently than intended, depending on how the `renderingContext` parameter is used within the method. If the code relies on features or methods that are specific to `RenderingContext<XhtmlSiteRenderer>`, those features or methods may not be available when using a `RenderContext<T>` instead. In that case, it may be necessary to find a different solution to the problem.

In general, it is always best to try to fix dependency issues like this by updating the dependencies to a version that is compatible with the code, rather than by modifying the code itself. However, if it is not possible to update the dependencies, then making changes like the one suggested in this patch may be a viable solution.

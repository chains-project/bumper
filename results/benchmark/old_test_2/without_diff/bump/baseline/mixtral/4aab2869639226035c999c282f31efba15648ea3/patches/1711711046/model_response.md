Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    Yaml yaml = YamlBuilder.yaml();
    try {
        return new YamlPolicy(
            new BlockingStorage(
                new Storages().newStorage(
                    sub.string("type"), yaml.loadAs(sub.toString(), Map.class)
                )
            )
        );
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```

This patch uses the `YamlBuilder` class to create a `Yaml` instance, which should be available in the updated version of the external dependency. It also uses the `loadAs` method to parse the YAML string as a map, which should be a compatible replacement for the `readYamlMapping` method.

The `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation is used to suppress the "unchecked" warning that is generated by the use of the `loadAs` method. This warning is not a problem in this case, because the method is known to return a `Map` instance.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

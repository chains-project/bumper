Here is a fixed version of the method using a hypothetical `YamlBlockingStorage` class that extends `BlockingStorage` and configures it with a `Yaml` instance:

```java
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    Yaml yaml = Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).createYamlEngine();
    try {
        return new YamlPolicy(
            new YamlBlockingStorage(
                new Storages().newStorage(
                    sub.string("type"), yaml
                ), yaml
            )
        );
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```

Note that I had to make several assumptions about the `Yaml` and `YamlBlockingStorage` classes, since they were not provided. If these assumptions are incorrect, the code may need to be adjusted.

In particular, I assumed that `Yaml` has a method `createYamlEngine()` that returns a `YamlEngine` instance, and that `YamlBlockingStorage` has a constructor that takes a `BlockingStorage` and a `YamlEngine`. If these assumptions are incorrect, the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here is a fixed version of the method using a different approach to load the YAML file:

```java
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    try (InputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(sub.string("type").getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
        return new YamlPolicy(new BlockingStorage(new Storages().newStorage(sub.string("type"), Yaml.createYamlInput(input).readYamlMapping())));
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```

In this version, the YAML file is loaded from a byte array created from the `type` string. This should work as long as the `type` string contains the contents of a valid YAML file. The `ByteArrayInputStream` is wrapped in a try-with-resources statement to ensure that it is properly closed.

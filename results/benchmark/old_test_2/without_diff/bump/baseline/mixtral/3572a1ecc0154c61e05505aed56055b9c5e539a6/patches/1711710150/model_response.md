Sure, I understand the requirements. Based on the information provided, it seems like the issue is that the class `TFastFramedTransport` from the package `org.apache.thrift.transport` cannot be found, which is likely due to a versioning issue with the dependency.

To fix this issue, you could consider using a different class for transport that is known to be available in the version of the dependency that you are using. For example, you could use the `TFramedTransport` class from the same package instead.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

// ...

public static TTransport createFramedTransport(TServerTransport serverTransport) {
  TFramedTransport transport;
  try {
    transport = new TFramedTransport(serverTransport);
  } catch (TTransportException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to create framed transport", e);
  }
  return transport;
}
```

This patch replaces the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class, which should be available in the version of the `org.apache.thrift` dependency that you are using.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Based on the given information, it seems like the issue is caused by a missing dependency for the `TFastFramedTransport` class. To fix this issue, you can add the necessary dependency to your project. However, since you've mentioned that I can only work on the client code and cannot change the external dependency, I will propose a different solution.

We can use a try-catch block to handle the exception that is being thrown when the `TFastFramedTransport` class cannot be found. Here's the updated code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException;

import java.io.Closeable;
import java.io.IOException;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport createFramedTransport(Closeable closeable) throws TTransportException {
        TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TTransport(closeable));
        try {
            // Attempt to upgrade to TFastFramedTransport
            return (TFastFramedTransport) transport;
        } catch (ClassCastException e) {
            // If the upgrade fails, return the original TFramedTransport
            return transport;
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we first create a `TFramedTransport` object as before. However, we then attempt to upgrade this transport to a `TFastFramedTransport` object using a try-catch block. If the upgrade is successful, we return the upgraded transport. If the upgrade fails (because the `TFastFramedTransport` class cannot be found), we catch the `ClassCastException` and return the original `TFramedTransport` object.

This way, we can handle the missing dependency gracefully and avoid the compilation error.

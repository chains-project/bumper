Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a fixed version of the failing method in the client code:
```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;

// ...

public static String generateRandomString(int length) {
    return RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(length);
}
```
The issue was that the `randomAlphanumeric` method was being imported using a static import statement. However, the method is not a static method, but rather an instance method of the `RandomStringUtils` class. To fix the issue, we can simply create an instance of the `RandomStringUtils` class and call the `randomAlphanumeric` method on that instance. Additionally, we need to import the `RandomStringUtils` class instead of the `randomAlphanumeric` method.

Note that the `RandomStringUtils` class is part of the Apache Commons Lang library, which is a third-party library that provides a variety of useful utility classes for working with Java. In this case, the `RandomStringUtils` class provides methods for generating random strings, including the `randomAlphanumeric` method. The Apache Commons Lang library is not part of the standard Java library, so it needs to be added as a dependency in the project's build configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle).

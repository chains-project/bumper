Based on the information provided, it seems that the error is caused by a missing dependency for the `org.junit.Ignore` class. To fix this issue, we can add the missing dependency to the project. However, since you mentioned that we can only work on the client code and cannot change the external dependencies, we can try to find a workaround in the client code.

One possible workaround is to use a conditional statement to check if the `Ignore` class is available at runtime, and if not, use a different approach to ignore the test case. Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
if (org.junit.runner.JUnitCore.class.getDeclaredMethod("ignore", Class.class) == null) {
    // If the Ignore class is not available, use a different approach to ignore the test case
    // For example, you can use a custom annotation or a property to mark the test case as ignored
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testCase() {
        // Test case implementation
    }
} else {
    // If the Ignore class is available, use it to ignore the test case
    @org.junit.Test
    @org.junit.Ignore
    public void testCase() {
        // Test case implementation
    }
}
```
This code checks if the `ignore` method is available in the `JUnitCore` class, which is part of the JUnit library. If the method is not available, it means that the `Ignore` class is not present, so we use a different approach to ignore the test case (in this example, by using a custom annotation or a property). If the method is available, we use the `Ignore` class to ignore the test case.

Note that this is just one possible workaround, and the actual solution may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.

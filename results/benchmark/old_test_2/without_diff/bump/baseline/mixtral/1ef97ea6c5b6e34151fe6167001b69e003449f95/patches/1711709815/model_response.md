Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a potential fix for the issue:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (from == null || to == null) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Both 'from' and 'to' arguments must not be null.");
    }
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
  }
```
The issue is that the `super.between(from, to)` method returns a `Date` object, but the method signature requires a `Timestamp` object to be returned. To fix this, we can get the time in milliseconds from the `Date` object using the `getTime()` method, and then create a new `Timestamp` object using the time in milliseconds.

Note that I added a null check for the `from` and `to` arguments to prevent a possible `NullPointerException`. This is not related to the original issue, but it's a good practice to validate input arguments and provide meaningful error messages.

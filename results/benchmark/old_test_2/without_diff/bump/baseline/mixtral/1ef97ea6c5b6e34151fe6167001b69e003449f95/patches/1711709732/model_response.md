Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a fixed version of your `between` method that should resolve the type mismatch error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
  return new Timestamp(time);
}
```

In this version, we first extract the time value from the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between` method using the `getTime()` method. We then pass this value to the `Timestamp` constructor to create a new `Timestamp` object. This avoids the type mismatch error that was causing the failure.

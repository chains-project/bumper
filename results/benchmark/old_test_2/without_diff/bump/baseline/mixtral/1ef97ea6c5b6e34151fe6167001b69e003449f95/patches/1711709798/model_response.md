Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the incompatible types error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```
In this version, we first extract the time in milliseconds from the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between` method using the `getTime()` method. Then, we use the extracted time to create a new `Timestamp` object. This should resolve the incompatible types error.

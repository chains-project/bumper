Sure, I understand the constraints and requirements. Here's a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  long fromTime = from.getTime();
  long toTime = to.getTime();
  return new Timestamp(fromTime < toTime ? fromTime : toTime);
}
```
This version of the method creates two new variables `fromTime` and `toTime` which are the `long` values of the input `Date` objects. It then checks if `from` is before `to` and if not, it sets `fromTime` to `toTime`. Finally, it creates a new `Timestamp` object using the `fromTime` value. This should resolve the error because it avoids the implicit conversion of `Date` to `Timestamp` and instead creates a new `Timestamp` object explicitly.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```
The problem with the original code is that it's trying to return a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, but the `between` method of the superclass returns a `java.util.Date` object.

To fix this, we can simply call the `getTime()` method of the `Date` object to get its timestamp value, and then use that value to create a new `Timestamp` object. Here's the updated code:
```java
  @Override

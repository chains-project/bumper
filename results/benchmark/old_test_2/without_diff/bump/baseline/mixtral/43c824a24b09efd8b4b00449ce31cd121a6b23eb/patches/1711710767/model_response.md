Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

// add the following import statement
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.jaxb.MarcFactory;

// replace the following line
// MarcFactory marcFactory = new MarcFactory();
// with the following line
MarcFactory marcFactory = new MarcFactory<>();
```
This patch imports the necessary class for `MarcFactory` and updates the constructor call to use a diamond operator. It's possible that the original code was written for an older version of Java that doesn't support the diamond operator, which was introduced in Java 7. By using the diamond operator, the correct type argument can be inferred from the right-hand side of the assignment, avoiding the need to explicitly specify the type argument.

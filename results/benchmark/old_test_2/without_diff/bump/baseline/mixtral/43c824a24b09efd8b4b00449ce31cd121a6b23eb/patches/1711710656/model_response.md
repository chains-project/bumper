Here is a potential fix for the issue you're experiencing:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;
```

The problem is that the `JsonBranch` class is not being used in the `MarcFactory` class. To resolve the issue, you can simply remove the unused import statement.

Here is the updated code:

```java
// no import statement for de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;
```

This should resolve the error message you were seeing.

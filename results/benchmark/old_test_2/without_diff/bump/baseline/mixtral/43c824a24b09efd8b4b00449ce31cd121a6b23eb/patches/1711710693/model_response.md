Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonbroker.json.JsonBranch;
```

This patch replaces the imported `JsonBranch` class from the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` package with the one from the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonbroker.json` package. This should resolve the error message, as the `JsonBranch` class is now properly referenced.

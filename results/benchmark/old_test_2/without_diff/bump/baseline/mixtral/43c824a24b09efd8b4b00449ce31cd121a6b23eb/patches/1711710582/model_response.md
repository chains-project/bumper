Sure, I understand the requirements. Based on the information provided, it seems like the class `JsonBranch` from the package `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` is not available in the classpath, causing the compilation error.

Assuming that the `JsonBranch` class is no longer available and needs to be removed from the import statement, I would suggest the following patch:
```java
-import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;
```
This patch removes the problematic import statement, which should resolve the compilation error. However, it's important to note that removing this import statement might cause other issues if the `JsonBranch` class is still being used in the code. In that case, you might need to replace it with an alternative implementation or remove the code that depends on it.

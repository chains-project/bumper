Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch for the `imagePulled` method:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
    return new TypeSafeMatcher<String>() {
        @Override
        protected boolean matchesSafely(String item) {
            return pattern.matcher(item).find();
        }

        @Override
        public void describeTo(Description description) {
            description.appendText("a string containing the substring: Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `pattern` that stores a compiled regular expression pattern. The `matchesSafely` method then uses this pattern to check if the given string matches the pattern. This should fix the error message about a missing return type.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` annotation, as it is good practice to keep it even if it is not strictly necessary. I also did not use any removed library methods, and I did not change the function signature.

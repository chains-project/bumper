Here is a fixed version of the `imagePulled` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Status:",
        "Downloaded",
        "image"
    );
}
```

In this version, I added three arguments to the `StringContains` constructor: `"Status:"`, `"Downloaded"`, and `"image"`. These arguments are used to specify substrings that must be present in the target string. By including these substrings, we can ensure that the `StringContains` constructor is able to find a match for the target string.

I also removed the `import static` statement for `org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString` because it is not needed in this version of the method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is a patched version of the failing client code that should fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;
import com.jcabi.s3.Ocket;

@Test
public class AwsOcketITCase {

    @Test
    @Override
    public void testUploadingFile() {
        final Ocket bucket = new S3("http://s3.amazonaws.com")
            .bucket("my-bucket");
        final String key = "my-object-key";
        final String value = "Hello, World!";
        bucket.put(key, value);
        final String got = bucket.get(key);
        assertEquals(value, got);
    }
}
```
In this patched version, I have replaced the problematic import statement with the correct one and created a new variable `bucket` of type `com.jcabi.s3.S3` which is used to interact with Amazon S3.

The `bucket` variable is then used to upload a file with key `my-object-key` and value `Hello, World!`. After uploading the file, the same key is used to retrieve the value and then it is checked if the retrieved value is the same as the original value.

Note that I have removed the `@Tv` annotation as it is not necessary for the test to pass and it is not related to the error message.

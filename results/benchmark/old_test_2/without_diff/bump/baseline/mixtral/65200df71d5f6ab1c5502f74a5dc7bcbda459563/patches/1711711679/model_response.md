Here is a proposed patch for the given failing code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()
            .setLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```
In this patch, I have replaced the usage of `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` with `new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()` to create a new instance of the builder. Additionally, I have replaced `addEnabledLanguages()` with `setLanguages()` to set the enabled languages for the analysis engine configuration. These changes should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    FileWorkingDirProvider workDirProvider = new FileWorkingDirProvider();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDirProvider(workDirProvider)
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

This patch creates a new `FileWorkingDirProvider` object and sets it as the working directory provider for the analysis engine configuration. This assumes that the `FileWorkingDirProvider` class is a new addition to the external dependency and is used to provide the working directory for the analysis engine. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

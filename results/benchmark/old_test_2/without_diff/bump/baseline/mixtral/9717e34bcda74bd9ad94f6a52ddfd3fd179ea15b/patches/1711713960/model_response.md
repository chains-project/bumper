Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;
import com.jcabi.github.mock.MkGithub;

public class FixedMkGithub extends MkGithub {
    public FixedMkGithub(Github github) {
        super(github);
    }
}
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement and the `MkGithub` class definition. The new `FixedMkGithub` class extends `MkGithub` and overrides its constructor to accept a `Github` object.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Github` class is still available and has not been removed in the new version. If this is not the case, a different solution would be needed.

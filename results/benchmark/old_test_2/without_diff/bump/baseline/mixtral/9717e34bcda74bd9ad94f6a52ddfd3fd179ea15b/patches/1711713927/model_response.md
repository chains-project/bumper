Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

public class MkGithub {
    protected Github github() {
        return new Github("your-github-token-here");
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the problematic import statement with a new one that imports the `Github` class from the `com.jcabi.github` package. It also provides a new implementation for the `github()` method that returns a new `Github` instance initialized with a GitHub token.

Note that you should replace `"your-github-token-here"` with your actual GitHub token. Also, make sure that the `Github` class and its constructor are still available in the version of the `jcabi-github` library that you are using.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

public class MkGithub {

    protected Github github() {
        return new Github("your-github-token-here");
    }

    // existing methods...

}
```
In this patch, we are importing the new version of the `Github` class from the `com.jcabi.github` package, which should be compatible with the `github()` method in the `MkGithub` class.

We also added a token parameter to the `Github` constructor, which is required by the new version of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the original code was using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class as a workaround for a missing feature in the old version of the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class. With the new version of the library, this workaround is no longer necessary.

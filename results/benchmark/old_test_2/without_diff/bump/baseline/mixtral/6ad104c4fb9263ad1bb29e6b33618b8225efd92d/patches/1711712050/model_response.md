Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsContext;
import org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.TlsCrypto;
import org.bouncycastle.util.Arrays;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // existing code

    @Override
    public byte[] decodeRecord(TlsContext context, byte[] record) throws IOException {
        TlsCrypto crypto = context.getCrypto();
        // existing code

        // Replace the failing line with the following:
        byte[] decodedRecord = crypto.decodeCiphertext(record);

        // existing code
    }

    // existing code
}
```
Explanation:

The original code imports `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription`, but the error message indicates that the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package does not exist. This suggests that the version of the Bouncy Castle library being used has removed or renamed this package.

To fix the issue, we can replace the failing line of code with a call to the `decodeCiphertext` method of the `TlsCrypto` class, which is still available in the latest version of the Bouncy Castle library. This method decodes the encrypted record using the appropriate decryption algorithm and returns the decrypted plaintext.

Note that we also need to import the `TlsContext` and `TlsCrypto` classes from the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package. These classes provide the necessary context and crypto functionality for TLS records.

Finally, we can remove the `Override` decorator from the `decodeRecord` method, since it is not overriding any method in the new version.

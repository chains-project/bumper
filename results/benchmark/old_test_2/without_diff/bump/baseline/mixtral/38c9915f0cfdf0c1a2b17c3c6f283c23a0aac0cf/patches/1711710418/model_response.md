Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

//...

@Override
public Scalar<Wallets> wallets() throws IOException {
  return new UncheckedScalar<>(() -> new HttpWallets(endpoint).wallets());
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `SolidScalar` class with the `Scalar` interface, which is a part of the Cactoos library and provides similar functionality. I also used the `UncheckedScalar` class to wrap a function that returns the `HttpWallets` object and retrieve the `wallets` method's result.

Note that this patch assumes that the `HttpWallets` class and the `endpoint` variable are defined and accessible in the scope of the `wallets` method. If this is not the case, the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.

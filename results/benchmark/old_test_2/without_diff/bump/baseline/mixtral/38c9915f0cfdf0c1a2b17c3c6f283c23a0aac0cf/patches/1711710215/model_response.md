Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.list.JoinedList;

//...

@Override
public InputStream walletsIn(String name) throws IOException {
  List<InputStream> inputs = new ArrayList<>();
  try (DirectoryStream<Path> dir = Files.newDirectoryStream(path)) {
    for (Path file : dir) {
      if (file.getFileName().toString().startsWith(name)) {
        inputs.add(Files.newInputStream(file));
      }
    }
  }
  return new SequenceInputStream(new JoinedList<>(inputs).iterator());
}
```

This patch uses the `JoinedList` class from the `cactoos` library to concatenate the `InputStream` objects returned by the `Files.newInputStream` method. The `JoinedList` class is an addition to the `cactoos` library and is identified with `++`.

The `SequenceInputStream` class from the `java.io` package is used to combine the `InputStream` objects returned by the `JoinedList` class.

Note that the `JoinedText` class from the `cactoos` library is not used in this patch, as it is not needed to fix the error.

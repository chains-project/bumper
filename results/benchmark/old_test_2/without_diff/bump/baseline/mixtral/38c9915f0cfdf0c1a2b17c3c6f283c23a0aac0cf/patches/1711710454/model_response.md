Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.func.ScalarOf;

// ...

@Override
public InputStream walletStream(String name) throws IOException {
  return new ScalarOf<InputStream>(() -> wallets.get(name).stream()).value();
}
```
In this patch, we use the `ScalarOf` class from the `cactoos-func` module instead of the `SolidScalar` class from the `cactoos-scalar` module. This is because the `cactoos-scalar` module has been removed in the updated version of the library. The `ScalarOf` class serves a similar purpose, converting a function that produces a value into a scalar (i.e., a value that can be converted to a stream).

Note that this patch assumes that the `wallets` variable is of type `Map<String, Wallet>`, where `Wallet` is some class that has a `stream()` method that returns an `InputStream`. You may need to adjust the code based on the actual type of the `wallets` variable.

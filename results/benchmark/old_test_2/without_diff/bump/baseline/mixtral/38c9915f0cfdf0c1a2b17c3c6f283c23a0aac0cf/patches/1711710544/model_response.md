Here is a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;

Scalar<Iterable<String>> wallets() {
  return new SolidScalar<Iterable<String>>() {
    @Override
    protected Iterable<String> value() throws Exception {
      // Existing implementation
    }
  };
}
```
This patch replaces the problematic import statement with one that uses the `Scalar` interface from the `cactoos` library, which should still be available. It then defines a new method `wallets` that returns a `Scalar` object, which is a functional interface that can be used to wrap a computation that produces a value of type `T`. The `Scalar` interface is part of the `cactoos` library and should still be available.

The `value` method of the `SolidScalar` class is then implemented using the existing implementation that was previously present in the failing code.

It's worth noting that this patch may not be a perfect solution, as it may require additional changes to the code in order to use the `Scalar` object returned by the `wallets` method. However, it should at least allow the code to compile and run, at which point the additional changes can be made as needed.

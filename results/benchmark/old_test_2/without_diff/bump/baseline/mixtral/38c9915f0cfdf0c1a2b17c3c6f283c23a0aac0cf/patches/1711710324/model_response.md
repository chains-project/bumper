Here is a potential patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;

// ...

@Override
public Text asText() throws IOException {
  return new Joined(Files.filesIn(new File(path)), "\n");
}
```

This patch replaces the `JoinedText` class with the `Joined` class, which is a replacement for the deprecated `JoinedText` class. The `Files.filesIn()` method is used to read all the files in a directory, and the `\n` character is used to join the contents of the files. The `Joined` class is a part of the `cactoos` library, which is a dependency of the `zold` library.

It is important to note that the `JoinedText` class has been deprecated since version 2.0 of the `cactoos` library, and it is recommended to use the `Joined` class instead. The `Files.filesIn()` method is a part of the `io.vavr` library, which is a dependency of the `cactoos` library.

Additionally, I have removed the `throws Exception` from the method signature and replaced it with `throws IOException` as it is more specific and catches only the IOException that might be thrown by the Files.filesIn() method.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the error. It's always a good idea to test the code thoroughly after applying any fixes to ensure that it is working as expected.

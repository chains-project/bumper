Here is a possible patch for the code:
```java
  @Override
  public Slice slice(final String action) {
    Set<Authentication.User> users = Set.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB);
    BiFunction<String, String, CompletableFuture<Optional<Authentication.User>>> tokenValidator = (token, tokenFromUser) ->
      CompletableFuture.completedFuture(
        users.stream()
            .filter(user -> tokenFromUser.equals(token(user)))
            .findFirst()
      );
    return new DockerSlice(
        new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()),
        new Permissions.Single(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), action),
        new BearerAuthScheme(tokenValidator, "")
    );
  }
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `users` to store the set of users, and a new variable `tokenValidator` to store the token validation logic. I then used these variables to create a new `BearerAuthScheme` object.

Note that I assumed that the `token` and `token()` methods are still available, as I did not see them marked as removed. If they are not available, the patch will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Also, I assumed that the `BearerAuthScheme` constructor that takes a `BiFunction` as an argument is still available, as I did not see it marked as removed. If it is not available, the patch will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Finally, I assumed that the `Authentication.User` constructor that takes a `String` argument is still available, as I did not see it marked as removed. If it is not available, the patch will need to be adjusted accordingly.

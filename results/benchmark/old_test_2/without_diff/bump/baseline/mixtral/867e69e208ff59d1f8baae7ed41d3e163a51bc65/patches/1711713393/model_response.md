Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patched version of the failing method in ThriftReader.java:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

@Override
public TTransport createTransport() throws TTransportException {
  TTransport transport = new TSocket(host, port);
  transport.setFramed(true);
  return transport;
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `TFramedTransport` class with `TSocket` and set the framed mode to true. This should have the same effect as the original code, but using the new version of the library.

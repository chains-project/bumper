Here is a proposed patch for the failing method in the client code:
```java
    private void resolveDependencies() throws DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
        if (this.artifact == null) {
            this.artifact = this.project.getArtifact();
        }
        this.dependency = new Dependency(this.artifact, this.artifact.getScope());
        this.dependency.setVersion("${tobago.version}");
        this.project.addDependency(this.dependency);

        // Resolve the dependencies of the project
        this.project.resolve();
    }
```
In this patch, I have added a null check for the `artifact` variable and initialized it with the project's artifact if it is null. This ensures that the `artifact` variable is not null and has a valid value. I have also added the missing import statement for the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class.

Note: I am assuming that the `tobago.version` property is defined in the project's pom.xml file. If it is not defined, then you may need to define it or use a different version number.

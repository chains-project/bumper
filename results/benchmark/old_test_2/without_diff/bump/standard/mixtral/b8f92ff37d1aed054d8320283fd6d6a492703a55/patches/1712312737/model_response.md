Here is a potential patch for the failing method:

```java
import org.apache.maven.shared.utils.os.LinuxDirectoryScanner;

static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    LinuxDirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new LinuxDirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder);
    return directoryScanner.scan();
}
```

This patch uses the `LinuxDirectoryScanner` class from the `org.apache.maven.shared.utils.os` package instead of the `DirectoryScanner` class from the `org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util` package. The `scan()` method of the `LinuxDirectoryScanner` class returns a list of classes, which is what the original method was trying to obtain. Note that this patch assumes that the input file is a directory and contains Java classes. If this is not the case, additional error handling may be necessary.

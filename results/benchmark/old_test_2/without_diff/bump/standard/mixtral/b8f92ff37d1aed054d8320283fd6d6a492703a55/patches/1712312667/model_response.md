Here is a fixed version of the `getClassesLoc` method that should resolve the error:
```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.shared.utils.runner.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.shared.utils.runner.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder);
    directoryScanner.setIncludes(new String[]{"**/*.class"});
    directoryScanner.scan();
    return directoryScanner.getIncludedFiles();
}
```
In this version, I replaced the usage of `org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner` with `org.apache.maven.shared.utils.runner.DirectoryScanner`, which provides similar functionality. I also replaced the call to `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` with a hard-coded include pattern of `"**/*.class"`, which should achieve the same result.

Note that this solution may not be ideal for all use cases, and it's always a good idea to thoroughly test any changes before deploying them to production.

Here's a patched version of the failing method that replaces the failing import statement with a working one:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, which means that the Bouncy Castle library is either not present or not correctly configured in the project.
To fix the error, I replaced the failing import statement with a working one that imports the `AlertDescription` class from the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package directly.
This should allow the code to compile and run correctly, as long as the Bouncy Castle library is present and correctly configured in the project.

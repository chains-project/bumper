Here's a potential patch for the given client code:
```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. This is because the `TFastFramedTransport` class appears to be a custom class that is not part of the standard Thrift library, and is not available in the classpath.

The `TFramedTransport` class is a part of the standard Thrift library and provides similar functionality to the `TFastFramedTransport` class. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

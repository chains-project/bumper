Here is a potential patch for the given code:
```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    Transport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os));
    transport.open();
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the `TFastFramedTransport` class cannot be found. This class may have been removed or renamed in a recent version of the external dependency.
To fix the error, we can use the `TFramedTransport` class instead, which provides similar functionality.
The `TFastFramedTransport` class is a custom implementation of `TFramedTransport` that was used in an older version of the singer\_thrift library.
To use `TFramedTransport`, we need to open the transport before using it with the `TBinaryProtocol`.
I made the following changes:

* Replaced `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport`.
* Removed the `bufferCapacity` parameter, as it is not used in the `TFramedTransport` constructor.
* Added a call to `transport.open()` before using the transport with the `TBinaryProtocol`.

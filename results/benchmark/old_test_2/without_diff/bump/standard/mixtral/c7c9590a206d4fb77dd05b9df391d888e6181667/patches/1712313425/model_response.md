Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
```
Note that I replaced the original import statement with a new one that imports `RenderingContext` from a different package. This should fix the error message you provided, as it suggests that the original package does not exist. However, it's possible that this change will cause other errors if the original package was actually being used elsewhere in the code. You may need to make additional changes to fully resolve any issues that arise.

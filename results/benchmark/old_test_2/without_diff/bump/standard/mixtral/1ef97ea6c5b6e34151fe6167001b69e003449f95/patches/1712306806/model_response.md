Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(Math.max(from.getTime(), to.getTime()) - Math.min(from.getTime(), to.getTime()));
}
```

This version calculates the difference between the two dates using their `getTime` method, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. It then creates a new `Timestamp` object using this difference.

Note that this version of the method does not call the `super.between` method, as it is not necessary to do so. If the `DateAndTime` class (the superclass of `DateTime`) has a `between` method that takes two `Date` arguments, then it is likely that it has the same issue with incompatible types as the original version of the `between` method. Therefore, it is best to avoid calling it.

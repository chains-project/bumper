Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error by returning a `Timestamp` instead of a `Date`:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, since the error message indicates that `Date` cannot be converted to `Timestamp`, we need to convert the `Date` objects returned by `super.between` to `Timestamp` objects before returning them. Here's an updated version of the method that does this:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(new Date(super.between(from, to).getTime()).getTime());
}
```

This version first converts the `Date` object returned by `super.between` to a `long` representing its time in milliseconds, creates a new `Date` object with that time, and then converts that `Date` object to a `Timestamp`. This ensures that the method returns a `Timestamp` object, which is compatible with the method signature.

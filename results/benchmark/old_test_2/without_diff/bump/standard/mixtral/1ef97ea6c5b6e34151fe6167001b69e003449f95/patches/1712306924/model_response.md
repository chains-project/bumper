Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change made is to explicitly specify the package names for the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes. This is necessary because the error message indicates that the `Date` class being passed to the `between` method is of type `java.util.Date`, while the `Timestamp` constructor expects a `java.sql.Date`. By explicitly specifying the package names, we ensure that the correct types are used throughout the method.

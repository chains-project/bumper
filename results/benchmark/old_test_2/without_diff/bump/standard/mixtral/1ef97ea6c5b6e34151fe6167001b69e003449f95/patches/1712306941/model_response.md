Here is a fixed version of your method that should resolve the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

It appears that the original code you provided is already correct, and the error message you received is misleading. The `between` method in the `DateAndTime` class likely returns a `Date` object, which can be converted to a `Timestamp` using the `getTime()` method.

Therefore, the issue may be caused by a mismatch between the expected return type of the `between` method in the `DateTime` class and the actual return type of the `between` method in the `DateAndTime` class.

To resolve this issue, you may need to update the return type of the `between` method in the `DateTime` class to match the return type of the `between` method in the `DateAndTime` class. For example:

```java
@Override
public Date between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return super.between(from, to);
}
```

Alternatively, you could modify the code that calls the `between` method in the `DateTime` class to handle the conversion from `Date` to `Timestamp` explicitly. For example:

```java
Date date = new Date();
Date from = new Date(date.getTime() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
Date to = new Date();

DateTime dateTime = new DateTime(faker);
Date between = dateTime.between(from, to);
Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(between.getTime());
```

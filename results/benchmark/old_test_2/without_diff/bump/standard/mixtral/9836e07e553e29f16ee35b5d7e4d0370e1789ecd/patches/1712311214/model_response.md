Here is a potential patch for the failing method:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringStartsWith(java.lang.String.format("Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

In this patch, I have replaced the `StringContains` constructor with the `StringStartsWith` constructor, which only requires a single `String` argument. This should resolve the error message, which indicates that the `StringContains` constructor is expecting a single `String` argument, but is receiving a `boolean` and a `String`.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import static tech.peyang.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```
Note: I replaced `develop.p2p.lib` with `tech.peyang.lib` as the package name since the error message suggests that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. This is just an example, and you may need to adjust the package name based on your actual project setup.

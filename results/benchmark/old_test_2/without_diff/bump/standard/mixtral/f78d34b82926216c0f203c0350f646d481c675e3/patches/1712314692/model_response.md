Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
import static ai.djl.basicmath.BasicMathFunctions.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.basicmath` package, which provides similar mathematical functions as the original library. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
import static ai.djl.basicmath.BasicMath.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.basicmath` package, which provides similar functionality as the original `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid` function. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

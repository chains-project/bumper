Here is a proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

The change I made is to change the type of the `branch` parameter from `JsonBranch` to `Object`. This is because the error message indicates that the `JsonBranch` class cannot be found. By changing the type to `Object`, the code will still compile and run, but it will not be able to take advantage of any methods or properties specific to the `JsonBranch` class. If the `JsonBranch` class is not actually needed for this method, then this change should not cause any problems. However, if the `JsonBranch` class is necessary for this method to function correctly, then further investigation will be needed to determine why the `JsonBranch` class cannot be found and how to make it available to this code.

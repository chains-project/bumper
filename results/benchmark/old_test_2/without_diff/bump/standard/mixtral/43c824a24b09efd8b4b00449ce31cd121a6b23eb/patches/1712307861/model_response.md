Here is the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

The change made is to replace `JsonBranch` with `Object` as a parameter type for the `extractFirst` method. The reason is that the error message indicates that the `JsonBranch` class cannot be found, which suggests that it might have been removed or renamed in the external dependency. By changing the parameter type to `Object`, the method can still accept any type of object as input, and the rest of the method implementation remains unchanged.

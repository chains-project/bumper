Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    // ... other methods ...

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        encryptor.setPassword("your-password-here");
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPassword.toString());
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```
Note that this patch replaces the use of `PBEPasswordEncoder` with `BasicTextEncryptor` from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. The `encode` method has also been updated to use the new encryptor. Make sure to replace `"your-password-here"` with an actual password.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing method. I added a type parameter to the `SortedMap` to make it generic, and changed the type of the `reg` variable accordingly.

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOGroup>> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOGroup>>) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

This patch uses Java generics to specify the type of the values in the `SortedMap`. This way, the cast on the fourth line of the method is safe and should not cause a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is used to suppress the "unchecked" warning that the Java compiler emits because of the explicit cast. This warning indicates that the code might not be type-safe, but in this case, it is, because we know that the `registry` field is of type `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOGroup>>`.

The `ClassCastException` is added to the `catch` block to handle the case where the `registry` field has a different type than expected. This is necessary because the error message indicates that the types are incompatible, which suggests that the type of the `registry` field might have changed in a dependency update.

Note that this patch assumes that the `ManagedObject` class is generic and takes a type parameter. If this is not the case, the patch might need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.getTestClasses());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```
The patch replaces the call to `getWildcard()` with `getTestClasses()`, which is a method added in the same version of the Surefire plugin that introduced the `getWildcard()` method. This method should be backwards compatible with the previous version, and should fix the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TestListResolver` class is still available and has the same signature as before. If the class or its signature has changed, a different patch may be necessary.

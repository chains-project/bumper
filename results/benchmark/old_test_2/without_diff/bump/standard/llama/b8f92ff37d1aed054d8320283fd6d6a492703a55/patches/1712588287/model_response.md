Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.getTestClasses());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```
The patch replaces the call to `getWildcard()` with `getTestClasses()`, which is a method added in the same version of the Surefire plugin that introduced the `getWildcard()` method. The `getTestClasses()` method returns a list of test classes, which can be used to fix the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the Surefire plugin version being used is 2.20.0 or higher, which is the version that introduced the `getTestClasses()` method. If the version of Surefire being used is lower than 2.20.0, a different patch may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch to fix the issue:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(false, () -> java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
The patch creates a lambda expression that formats the string using the `String.format` method, and passes the formatted string to the `StringContains` constructor. This avoids the issue of passing a boolean and a string to the constructor, which is not allowed.

Note that this patch assumes that the `StringContains` class has a constructor that takes a function as its second argument, which is called with the formatted string. If this is not the case, a different patch may be needed.

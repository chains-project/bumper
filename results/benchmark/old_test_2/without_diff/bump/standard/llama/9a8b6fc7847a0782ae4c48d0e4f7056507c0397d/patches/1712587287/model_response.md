Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// Replace the failing line with the following code:
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;
```
This patch replaces the import statement for `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` with `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder`.

The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been moved from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package to the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package in Spring Security 5.0.

By updating the import statement, the code will now use the correct version of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class, and the error should be resolved.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
/**
 * Create repo with random name.
 *
 * @return Repo
 * @throws IOException
 * 		If fails
 */
public com.jcabi.github.Repo randomRepo() throws java.io.IOException {
    int tv = 20; // Replace Tv.TWENTY with a constant value
    return this.repos().create(new com.jcabi.github.Repos.RepoCreate(org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(tv), true));
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the variable `Tv` with a constant value `20`, which should be sufficient for the method to work. The `Tv` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it's likely that it's a typo or a missing import.

Note that this patch only fixes the error in the provided code snippet, and there may be other issues with the code that this patch does not address.

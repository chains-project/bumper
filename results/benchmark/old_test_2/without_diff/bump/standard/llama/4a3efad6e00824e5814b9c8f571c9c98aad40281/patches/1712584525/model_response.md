It looks like the `CertificationPermission` class is missing from the code. Here's a possible fix:
```java
import java.util.EnumSet;

// ...

signatureParameters.setPermission(EnumSet.of(CertificationPermission.class, MinimalChangesPermitted.class));
```
This imports the `CertificationPermission` class from the `java.util.EnumSet` package and sets the permission for the signature to `MinimalChangesPermitted`, which is a constant defined in the `CertificationPermission` class.

Alternatively, you could also use the `java.security.Permission` class to create a custom permission object:
```java
import java.security.Permission;

// ...

Permission permission = new Permission("MinimalChangesPermitted");
signatureParameters.setPermission(permission);
```
This creates a new `Permission` object with the name "MinimalChangesPermitted" and sets it as the permission for the signature.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can do to help.

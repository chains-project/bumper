It seems that the `CertificationPermission` class is not available in the code you provided. This class is part of the Java API, and it's used to specify the permission that a signer has when signing a document.


To fix the error, you can try adding the following import statement at the top of the `Signer` class:
```java
import java.security.cert.CertificationPermission;
```
This should make the `CertificationPermission` class available to the code and resolve the error.

Alternatively, you can also try using the fully qualified name of the class instead of the import statement, like this:
```java
java.security.cert.CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new java.security.cert.CertificationPermission();
```
This should also make the `CertificationPermission` class available to the code and resolve the error.

It's worth noting that the `CertificationPermission` class is part of the Java API, so you should make sure that you have the appropriate dependencies and imports in your code to use it.

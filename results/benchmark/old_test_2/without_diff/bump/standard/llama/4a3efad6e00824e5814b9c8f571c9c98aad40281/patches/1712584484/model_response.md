It looks like the `CertificationPermission` class is not available in the `org.openpdfsign` package. This could be due to a missing dependency or a version conflict.

To fix this error, you can try adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file (if you're using Maven):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openpdfsign</groupId>
    <artifactId>openpdfsign-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```
Alternatively, you can try using a different version of the `openpdfsign` library that includes the `CertificationPermission` class.

Additionally, you may need to check the compatibility of the `openpdfsign` library with the version of PDFBox you're using. PDFBox 2.0.20 includes a fix for a bug that affected the `PdfBoxNativeObjectFactory` class, which is used in the code you provided.

Here's a patch that includes the necessary changes to fix the error:

        // ...
    }
```
This patch adds the `CertificationPermission` import statement and updates the `signPdf` method to use the `CertificationPermission` enumeration.

Note that this is just a temporary solution to help you fix the error. You may need to make further changes to your code to ensure that it works correctly with the `openpdfsign` library.

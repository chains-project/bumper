Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;

// Create a new variable to hold the directory scanner instance
DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner();

// Replace the failing line with a call to the constructor that takes a directory path
directoryScanner.setIncludedDirectories(new String[] {"src/main/java"});
```
This patch creates a new variable `directoryScanner` to hold the `DirectoryScanner` instance, and sets the `includedDirectories` property to an array with the directory path `"src/main/java"`. This should fix the error by providing a valid directory path to the `DirectoryScanner` constructor.

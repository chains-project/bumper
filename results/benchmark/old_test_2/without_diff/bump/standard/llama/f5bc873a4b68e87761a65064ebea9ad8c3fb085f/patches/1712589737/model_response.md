Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;

// Create a new variable to hold the DirectoryScanner instance
DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner();

// Replace the failing line with the following code
directoryScanner.setIncludes("**/*.css");
```
This patch creates a new variable `directoryScanner` to hold the `DirectoryScanner` instance, and then sets the `includes` method to include only CSS files. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

// Add a variable to hold the result of assumeTrue
boolean canRun = assumeTrue(true);

// Replace the failing line with this code
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
```
This patch creates a variable `canRun` to hold the result of `assumeTrue(true)`, and then uses that variable to replace the failing line. This allows the code to continue executing without the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `assumeTrue` method is not actually needed in the code, and that the `canRun` variable can be used instead. If this is not the case, a different approach may be needed.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
// Replace the line with the following code:
first = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(first);
last = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(last);

// With:
first = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.stripAccents(first);
last = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.stripAccents(last);
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `develop.p2p.lib` package does not exist. To fix this, we can replace the `LeetConverter` class with a different class that can perform the same function. In this case, we can use the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` class, which has a method called `stripAccents()` that can be used to remove accents from a string.

The `stripAccents()` method takes a string as input, and returns a new string with the accents removed. We can use this method to replace the accents in the `first` and `last` variables with their corresponding unaccented versions.


Note that this patch assumes that the `org.apache.commons.lang3` package is available in the project's classpath. If this package is not available, you may need to add it to the project's dependencies.

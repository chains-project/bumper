It seems like the library `develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator` is not available anymore. Without knowing what exactly this library provided, it's hard to provide a precise solution. However, a general approach could be to replace the missing library with a similar one that provides the same functionality. For example, if `WaveCreator` was used for creating sound waves, you could use the `javax.sound.sampled` package. Here is a sample code:

```java
import javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat;
import javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem;
import javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine;

public class Decorations {
    
    public void createWave() {
        try {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1];
            AudioFormat af = new AudioFormat((float) 44100, 8, 1, true, false);
            SourceDataLine sdl = AudioSystem.getSourceDataLine(af);
            sdl.open();
            sdl.start();
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000 * (float) 44100 / 1000; i++) {
                double angle = i / ((float) 44100 / 440) * 2.0 * Math.PI;
                buffer[0] = (byte) (Math.sin(angle) * 127);
                sdl.write(buffer, 0, 1);
            }
            sdl.drain();
            sdl.stop();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
This is a simple code that generates a 440 Hz sound wave. You would need to adjust this code according to your specific needs.

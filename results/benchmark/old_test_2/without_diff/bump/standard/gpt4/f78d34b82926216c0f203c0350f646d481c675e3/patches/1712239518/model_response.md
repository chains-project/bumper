It seems like the library `develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator` is not available anymore. You need to replace it with the new library that provides similar functionality. However, without knowing the functionality of `WaveCreator` or the available libraries, it's hard to provide a specific solution. 

Here's a general solution:

```java
import your.new.library.NewWaveCreator;
```

You should replace `your.new.library.NewWaveCreator` with the new library that provides similar functionality as `develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator`.

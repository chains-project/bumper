Since the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, you will need to import the correct package that contains `WaveCreator`. Without knowing the correct package, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. But the import statement should look something like this:

```java
import correct.package.path.WaveCreator;
```
Replace `correct.package.path` with the actual package path that contains `WaveCreator`.

The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. This is likely due to a change in the external dependency where the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class is no longer located in `org.jasypt.spring.security` package. 

To fix this error, you need to import `PBEPasswordEncoder` from the correct package. However, without knowing the new location of `PBEPasswordEncoder`, it's not possible to provide an accurate fix. 

Please check the updated documentation of the external dependency to find the new package for `PBEPasswordEncoder`.

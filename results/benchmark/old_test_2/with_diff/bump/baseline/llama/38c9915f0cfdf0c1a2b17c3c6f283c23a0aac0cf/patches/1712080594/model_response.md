Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final IoCheckedScalar<InputStream> inputStream;

    public WalletsIn(IoCheckedScalar<InputStream> inputStream) {
        this.inputStream = inputStream;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `IoCheckedScalar` and instead imports the `IoCheckedScalar` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. Additionally, the constructor parameter's type is changed to `IoCheckedScalar<InputStream>` to match the updated method signature.


It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `IoCheckedScalar` class has not changed in the new library version and that the changes made to the library do not affect the client code's functionality.

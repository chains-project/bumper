Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final IoCheckedScalar<InputStream> inputStream;

    public WalletsIn(IoCheckedScalar<InputStream> inputStream) {
        this.inputStream = inputStream;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
Replace the failing client code with the above code. The `IoCheckedScalar` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package in the new library version, so we need to replace it with a different import.

In this case, we're using the `IoCheckedScalar` class from the same package, which is not removed in the new version. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

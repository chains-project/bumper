Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.cactoos.text.Text;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final Text joiner;

    public WalletsIn(Text joiner) {
        this.joiner = joiner;
    }

    public String getWalletIds() {
        return joiner.join("', '", "SELECT DISTINCT w.id FROM Wallet w WHERE w.user_id = ?1 AND w.status = ?2", "id");
    }
}
```
The patch replaces the import statement for `JoinedText` with `Text` from the same package, and changes the constructor parameter name from `joinedText` to `joiner`. It also changes the method call in the `getWalletIds()` method from `joinedText.join()` to `joiner.join()`.

These changes address the reported error by removing the dependency on the removed `JoinedText` class and replacing it with the still existing `Text` class.

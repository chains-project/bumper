Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.NULL;

    public void testRegion() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and initializes it with `Tv.NULL`. This allows the code to compile without the need for the `Tv` class, which has been removed in the new library version. The field can be used instead of the removed `Tv` class to access the `Tv` constants.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that the `Tv.NULL` constant is not used in any other way that would cause issues with the patch. If this is not the case, a more comprehensive patch may be required.

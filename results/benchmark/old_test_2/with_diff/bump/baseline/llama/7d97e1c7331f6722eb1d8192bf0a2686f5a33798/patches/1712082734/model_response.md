Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.NULL;

    public void testRegion() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and sets it to `Tv.NULL`. This allows the code to compile without the need for the `Tv` class, which is not available in the updated library version.


Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing it does not cause any issues. If the `Tv` class is used elsewhere, a more comprehensive solution may be required.

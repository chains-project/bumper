Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.NULL;

    public void testSomething() {
        //your code here
    }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and initializes it with `Tv.NULL`. This allows the code to compile without the error, as the symbol `Tv` is now accessible.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is still present in the updated library version, and that the `Tv.NULL` constant is still a valid value. If this is not the case, a different approach may be needed.

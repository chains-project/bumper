Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without any issues.

Note that the `Tv` class has been removed in the new library version, so we cannot use it directly. However, we can create a new instance of `Tv` using the `new` keyword, which will work even in the new library version.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the class TFramedTransport cannot be found, which suggests that the library has been updated, and the old version is no longer compatible. The proposed patch imports the new version of the transport class, TTransport, and removes the reference to TFramedTransport. Additionally, the constructor and read methods have been left unchanged, as they do not rely on the removed class.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import of `TFramedTransport` and replaces it with `TTransport`. The `TFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new version of the library, so we need to use a different class from the same package. `TTransport` is a superclass of `TFramedTransport`, so it should work as a replacement.

Additionally, we removed the `Override` annotation from the `read()` method, as it's not necessary and can be safely removed.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class SimpleThriftLogger {
    private TTransport transport;

    public SimpleThriftLogger(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        transport.write(message.getBytes());
    }
}
```

The patch removes the import of `TFramedTransport` and replaces it with `TTransport`. Additionally, it removes the constructor parameter `TFramedTransport` and replaces it with `TTransport`. This is because `TFramedTransport` has been removed from the new version of the library, and `TTransport` is the new base class for all thrift transports.


By making these changes, the code should now compile without any errors related to `TFramedTransport`.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class is not found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. The issue is likely caused by a version conflict between the thrift library used by the client code and the version of the library that was used to compile the code.

To fix the issue, we can replace the import statement for `TFramedTransport` with an import statement for `TTransport`, which is the superclass of `TFramedTransport`. This ensures that the code will work with both the old and new versions of the thrift library.

Additionally, we can remove the `Override` decorator from the `read()` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed without affecting the code's functionality.

Here's the patch applied to the original code:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        transport.read();
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the class `TFramedTransport` cannot be found, which suggests that the library version has changed and the old version is no longer compatible. To fix this issue, we need to update the import statement and remove any references to `TFramedTransport`.

Instead, we can import the `TTransport` class from the same package, which is still available in the new version of the library. We can then modify the constructor to accept an instance of `TTransport` instead of `TFramedTransport`, and remove any unnecessary code references to `TFramedTransport`.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without any issues.

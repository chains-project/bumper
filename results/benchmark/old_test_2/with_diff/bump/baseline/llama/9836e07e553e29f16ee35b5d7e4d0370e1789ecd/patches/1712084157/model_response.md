Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor that takes two arguments has been replaced with an anonymous class that overrides the `matches` method. The `matches` method checks if the input string contains the expected string format, which is constructed by concatenating the image name with the message.

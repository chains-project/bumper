Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
public void input(ArrayList<Input> inputData) {
    inputData.parallelStream().forEachOrdered(input -> {
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.getWeightingValue().length; i++) {
            sum += input.getWeightingValue()[i] * sigmoid(input.getInputValues()[i]);
        }
        setValue(sum);
    });
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the absence of the `sigmoid` method in the `LearnMath` class. The `sigmoid` method has been removed in the new version of the library. To fix this error, we can use the `sigmoid` method from the `tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath` class, which is a new addition in the updated library.

We can also remove the `Override` decorator, as the `input` method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Note that this patch assumes that the `sigmoid` method in the `tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath` class has the same signature as the removed `sigmoid` method in the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class. If the signature is different, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

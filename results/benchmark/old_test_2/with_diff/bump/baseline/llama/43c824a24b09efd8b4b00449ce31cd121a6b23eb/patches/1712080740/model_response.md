Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();

    public static Marc createMarc() {
        JsonBranch jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static variable `jsonBranch` of type `JsonBranch` and assigns it a new instance of `JsonBranch()`. This allows the `createMarc()` method to use the same instance of `JsonBranch` instead of trying to import it again, which causes the error.

By creating a static variable, we avoid the need to import `JsonBranch` in the method, and we can use the `jsonBranch` variable instead. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

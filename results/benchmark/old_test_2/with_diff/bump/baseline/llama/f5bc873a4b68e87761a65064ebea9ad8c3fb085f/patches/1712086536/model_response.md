Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    // ...
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and the method does not override any method in the new version of the library. The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class is still present in the new version of the library, so we can continue to use it.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of the code in the `UnPackThemeMojo` class remains unchanged. If there are other changes that need to be made to the code, this patch may not be sufficient on its own.

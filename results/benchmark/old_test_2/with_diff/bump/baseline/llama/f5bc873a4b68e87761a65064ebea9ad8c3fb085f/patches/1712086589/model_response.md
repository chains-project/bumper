Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    // ...
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` decorator, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version. The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class is now imported, so the code can compile without errors.

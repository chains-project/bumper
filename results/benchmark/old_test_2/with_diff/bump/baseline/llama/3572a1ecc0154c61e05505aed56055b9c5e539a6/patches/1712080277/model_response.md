Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the latest version of the Thrift library. To fix this, we need to replace all occurrences of `TFastFramedTransport` with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a subclass of `TTransport` and can be used as a drop-in replacement for `TFastFramedTransport`. We can create an instance of `TIOStreamTransport` using the `TConfiguration` object and an `InputStream` or `OutputStream` object.

In the `AppenderUtils` class, we define a static method `getTransport` that takes a `TTransport` argument and returns a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance. This method can be used instead of the removed `TFastFramedTransport$Factory` class.


Note that we've also imported the `TIOStreamTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, as it's not included in the default Thrift package.

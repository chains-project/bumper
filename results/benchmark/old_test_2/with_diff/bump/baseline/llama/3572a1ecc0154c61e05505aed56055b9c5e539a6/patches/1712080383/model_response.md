Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the latest version of the Thrift library. To fix this, we need to replace all instances of `TFastFramedTransport` with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

The proposed patch replaces the `TFastFramedTransport` import with `TIOStreamTransport`, and changes the factory method `getTransport()` to return a `TIOStreamTransport` instance instead of a `TFastFramedTransport` instance.

Note that we also had to remove the `Override` annotation, as the `getTransport()` method is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

This patch should allow the client code to compile and run without any issues.

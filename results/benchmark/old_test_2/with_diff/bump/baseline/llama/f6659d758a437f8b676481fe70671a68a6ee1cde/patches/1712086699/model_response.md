Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    // ...
    private static final TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
    // ...
}
```
The patch creates a static variable `trustedTagInspector` of type `TrustedTagInspector` and initializes it with a new instance of `TrustedTagInspector()`. This allows the code to use the `TrustedTagInspector` class without any changes to the method signature.

The patch also removes the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still available in the updated library version. If the class has been removed, a different approach would be needed to fix the error.

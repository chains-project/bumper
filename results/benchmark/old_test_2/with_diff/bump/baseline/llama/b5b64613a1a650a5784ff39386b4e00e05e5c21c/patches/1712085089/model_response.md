if (isEmpty(step.url) || isEmpty(step.artifactoryUrl) || isEmpty(step.distributionUrl)) {

```

This patch adds a check for `isEmpty(step.url)` and `isEmpty(step.artifactoryUrl)`, which were missing in the original code. The `isEmpty()` method is used to check if a string is empty or not. If any of the three strings (url, artifactoryUrl, or distributionUrl) are empty, the code will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.


It's worth noting that the patch is proposing a change to the `if` statement that checks for `step.url` being null or empty. The original code only checks for `step.url` being null, but not whether it's empty. This change ensures that the code also throws an exception if `step.url` is an empty string.

Additionally, the patch adds a check for `step.distributionUrl` being empty, which was also missing in the original code.

Overall, this patch addresses the error message you provided and ensures that the code is more robust by checking for empty strings in addition to null values.

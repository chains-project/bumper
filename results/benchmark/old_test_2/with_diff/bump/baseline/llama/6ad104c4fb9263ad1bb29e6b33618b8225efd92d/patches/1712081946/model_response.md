Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public TlsFatalAlert getAlertDescription() {
    return TlsFatalAlert.getInstance(getAlertDescription().getValue());
}
```
This patch removes the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription` import and uses the `TlsFatalAlert` class to get the alert description. It also removes the `Override` annotation as the `getAlertDescription()` method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TlsFatalAlert` class is still available in the updated library version. If it's not, you may need to adapt the patch accordingly.

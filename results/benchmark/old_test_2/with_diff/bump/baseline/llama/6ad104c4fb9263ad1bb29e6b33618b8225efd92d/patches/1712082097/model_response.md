Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AlertDescription alertDescription = AlertDescription.create(AlertDescription.CRYPTO_FAILURE, "ChachaDecoder failure");
        System.out.println(alertDescription.getMessage());
    }
}
```
We imported the `AlertDescription` class from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package, which is not available in the new library version. To fix this, we can use the `AlertDescription` class from the same package, but with a different constructor. We create a new `AlertDescription` object using the `create` method that takes two parameters: the first is an integer representing the alert level, and the second is a message describing the alert. In this case, we set the alert level to `AlertDescription.CRYPTO_FAILURE` and set the message to "ChachaDecoder failure". Finally, we print the message of the `AlertDescription` object to the console using the `getMessage` method.

Note that we did not need to remove or modify any methods, as the `TlsFatalAlert` class and its `getAlertDescription` method have been removed in the new library version. Instead, we've used the `AlertDescription` class with a different constructor to achieve the same result.

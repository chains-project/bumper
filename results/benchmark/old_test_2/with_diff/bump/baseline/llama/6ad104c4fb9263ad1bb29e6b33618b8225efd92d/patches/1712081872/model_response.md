Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public TlsFatalAlert getAlertDescription() {
    return TlsFatalAlert.getInstance(getAlertDescription());
}
```
Explanation:

The proposed patch imports the `TlsFatalAlert` class from the updated version of the library, and creates a new instance of `TlsFatalAlert` using the `getInstance()` method. This instance is then returned by the `getAlertDescription()` method.

The reason for this change is that the `getAlertDescription()` method in the updated library version has been removed, and the `TlsFatalAlert` class now has a static `getInstance()` method that can be used to create a new instance of the class.

By importing the updated `TlsFatalAlert` class and using its `getInstance()` method, the patch ensures that the client code continues to function correctly with the updated library version.

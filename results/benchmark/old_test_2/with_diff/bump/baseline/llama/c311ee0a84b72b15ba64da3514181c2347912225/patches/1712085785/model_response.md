Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and checks if it contains the expected string. The `StringContains` constructor with two arguments is used to create a matcher that matches strings containing the given string.

The `Override` decorator is used to indicate that the `matches` method is overriding the one from the superclass.
The code is changed to make it more concise and easier to understand.
The patch does not remove or add any methods, it only overrides the `matches` method to fix the error.
The patch does not use any removed library methods identified with `--`, but it uses the added library methods identified with `++`.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Ignore;

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    @Ignore
    public void testPolygonize() {
        //TODO: Write test code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Ignore` class is not found in the `org.junit` package. This suggests that the `org.junit` package has been updated and the `Ignore` class has been removed.

To fix the error, we can replace the `Ignore` class with the `org.junit.jupiter.api.Ignored` class, which is the replacement for the `Ignore` class in the updated `org.junit` package.

Therefore, we can replace the line `import org.junit.Ignore;` with `import org.junit.jupiter.api.Ignored;`.

Additionally, we can add the `@Ignored` annotation to the test method `testPolygonize()` to replace the `@Ignore` annotation.

With these changes, the patched code should compile and run successfully.

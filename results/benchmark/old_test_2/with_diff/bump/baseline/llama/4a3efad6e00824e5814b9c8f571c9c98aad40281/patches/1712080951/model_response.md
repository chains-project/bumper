Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

// Create a variable for the certification permission
CertificationPermission certificationPermission = null;

// Check if the certification permission is present
if (certificationPermission != null) {
    // Do something with the certification permission
}
```
This patch creates a variable for the `CertificationPermission` class and checks if it's not null before using it. This way, the code won't fail if the class is not available.

It's important to note that this is just a temporary solution to fix the error, and it's recommended to update the dependency to the latest version as soon as possible.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

// Create a variable for the certification permission
CertificationPermission certificationPermission = null;

// Check if the certification permission is not null
if (certificationPermission != null) {
    // Do something with the certification permission
}
```
This patch creates a variable for the `CertificationPermission` class and checks if it's not null before using it. This should fix the error caused by the missing `CertificationPermission` class.


It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `CertificationPermission` class is not used anywhere else in the code, and that it's safe to remove it. If the class is used elsewhere, a different approach may be needed.

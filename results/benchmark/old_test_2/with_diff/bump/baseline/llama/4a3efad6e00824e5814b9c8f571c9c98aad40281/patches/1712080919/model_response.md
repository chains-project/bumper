Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static variable `certificationPermission` of type `CertificationPermission` and assigns it a new instance of `CertificationPermission()`. This allows the code to use the `CertificationPermission` class without causing a compile error.


It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `CertificationPermission` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that it's safe to create a static instance of it. If this is not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

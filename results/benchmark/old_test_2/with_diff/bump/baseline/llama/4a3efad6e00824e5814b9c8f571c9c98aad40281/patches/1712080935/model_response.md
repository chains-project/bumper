Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

// Create a variable for the certification permission
CertificationPermission certificationPermission = null;

// Get the certification permission from the library
certificationPermission = eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission.getInstance();

// Use the certification permission to sign the PDF
certificationPermission.signPDF();
```
This patch creates a variable for the certification permission and initializes it with an instance of the `CertificationPermission` class. It then uses the `signPDF()` method of the certification permission to sign the PDF.

This patch should fix the error by providing a valid reference to the `CertificationPermission` class, which is no longer available in the updated library version.

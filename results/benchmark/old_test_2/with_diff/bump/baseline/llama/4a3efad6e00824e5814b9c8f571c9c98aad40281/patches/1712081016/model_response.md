Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

// Create a variable for the certification permission
CertificationPermission certificationPermission = null;

// Check if the certification permission is not null
if (certificationPermission != null) {
    // Do something with the certification permission
}
```
This patch creates a variable for the `CertificationPermission` class and checks if it's not null before using it. This way, the code will not fail if the class is not available.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `CertificationPermission` class is not used anywhere else in the code, if it's used in other places, you'll need to update those places as well.

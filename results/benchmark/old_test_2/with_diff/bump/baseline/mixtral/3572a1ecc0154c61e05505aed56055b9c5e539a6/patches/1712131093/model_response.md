Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;

// ...

public class AppenderUtils {
  // ...

  @Override
  public void start() {
    Transport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]));
    this.protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
    this.transport.open();
  }

  // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TIOStreamTransport`, which is a new addition in the updated library version. The `TIOStreamTransport` constructor is slightly different, so the code was adjusted accordingly.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;

// ...

TFastFramedTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0])));
```

This patch replaces the use of `TFastFramedTransport` with a new constructor that takes a `TIOStreamTransport` as an argument. The `TIOStreamTransport` constructor takes a `TConfiguration` and an `InputStream` (which can be a `ByteArrayInputStream` with an empty byte array). This should allow the code to compile and run with the updated library version.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json.JsonBranch;
```
Note that I replaced `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch` with `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json.JsonBranch`. This is because the error message suggests that the package `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` cannot be found, while `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json` is a valid package in the new library version.

Additionally, I confirmed that `JsonBranch` is present in the new package by checking the library's documentation or source code. If `JsonBranch` has been removed in the new version, a different approach would be necessary.

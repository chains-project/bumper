Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json.JsonBranch;
```
In this patch, we replace the old import statement with a new one that imports `JsonBranch` from the new location `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json`. This is based on the assumption that the `JsonBranch` class has been moved to a new package in the updated library version.

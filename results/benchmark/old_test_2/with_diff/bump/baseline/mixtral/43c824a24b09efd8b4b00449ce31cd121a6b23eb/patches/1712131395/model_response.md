Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonPath;

//...

@Override
public JsonBranch getBranch(String branch) {
    return JsonPath.compile(branch).read(jsonNode);
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `JsonBranch` import with `JsonPath` and updated the method to return a `JsonBranch` object created using the `JsonPath.compile(branch).read(jsonNode)` method. This method was added in the new library version, indicated by `++`.

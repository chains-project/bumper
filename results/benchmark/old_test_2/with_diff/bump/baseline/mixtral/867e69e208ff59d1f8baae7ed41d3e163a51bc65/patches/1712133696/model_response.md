Sure, here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```
Explanation:
In the new library version, the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed and replaced with a new class called `FramedTransport`. To fix the error, we can simply import the new `FramedTransport` class and use it instead of `TFramedTransport`. We can create a new variable `transport` of type `TFramedTransport` and initialize it with an instance of `FramedTransport`. This way, we can ensure that the rest of the code that depends on `transport` still works as expected.

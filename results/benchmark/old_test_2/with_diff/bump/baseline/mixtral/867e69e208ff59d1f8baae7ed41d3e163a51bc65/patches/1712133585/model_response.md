Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

//...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `TFramedTransport` cannot be found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. Looking at the library changes, we can see that `TFramedTransport` has been removed and replaced with `FramedTransport` in the same package. Therefore, we can fix the error by importing `FramedTransport` and creating a new instance of it instead of `TFramedTransport`. Note that we can still use `TFramedTransport` as the type of the `transport` variable since it is part of the public API and has not been removed.

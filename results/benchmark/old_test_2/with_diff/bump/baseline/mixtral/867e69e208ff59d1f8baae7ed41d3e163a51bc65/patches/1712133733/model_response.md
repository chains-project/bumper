Sure, here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public TTransport createTransport(final String serverAddress, final int serverPort) {
    TTransport transport = new TSocket(serverAddress, serverPort);
    transport = new TFramedTransport(transport);
    transport.open();
    return transport;
}
```

In this updated version, I've imported the `TSocket` class from `org.apache.thrift.transport` and added it to the method. This allows us to create a `TSocket` instance that can be wrapped with a `TFramedTransport`.

Note that the `TFramedTransport` class is still being used, but it's being initialized with a `TSocket` instance instead of a `TTransport` instance. This is because the `TFramedTransport` constructor that takes a `TTransport` argument has been removed in the new library version.

By using the `TSocket` class instead, we can ensure that the code is compatible with both the old and new library versions.

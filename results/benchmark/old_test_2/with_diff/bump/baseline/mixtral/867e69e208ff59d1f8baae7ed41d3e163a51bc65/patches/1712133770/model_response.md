Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```
In the new library version, the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed and replaced with a new `FramedTransport` class. To fix the error, we can simply import and use the new `FramedTransport` class instead. Note that the `FramedTransport` class has the same constructor as the old `TFramedTransport` class, so the rest of the code can remain unchanged.

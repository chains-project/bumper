I cannot directly access your code, but I can suggest a modification to the failing import statement based on the information you provided.

The error message suggests that the class `CertificationPermission` cannot be found in the package `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades`. If the library version has changed and the class has been removed, you may need to import a different class or use a different approach to achieve the same functionality.

Based on the information provided, I cannot determine the exact replacement for the removed class. However, I can suggest removing the failing import statement, as it is causing the compilation error. Here's the modified code:

```java
// Remove the following import statement
// import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;
```

Please note that removing the import statement may cause further issues if the `CertificationPermission` class is used elsewhere in your code. You may need to modify the code to use a different class or approach to achieve the same functionality.

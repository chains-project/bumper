Here's the proposed patch to fix the error in the `UnPackThemeMojo.java` file:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

...

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
    try {
        // Existing code that depends on DependencyResolutionRequiredException should be updated
        // to handle ResolverException instead.
        getResolver().resolve(getProject().getArtifact(), getProject().getRemoteRepositories(), getLocalRepository(), getArtifactMetadataSource());

        // Rest of the method code remains unchanged.
    } catch (ResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to resolve artifact: " + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
```

In this patch, the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` import statement is changed to `ResolverException`, and the `getResolver().resolve()` method call is updated accordingly. The rest of the method code remains unchanged.

Please note that this patch assumes that the existing code that depends on `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been updated to handle `ResolverException` instead. If not, further modifications may be required.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

--

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    try {
        super.execute();
    } catch (ResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to resolve dependencies", e);
    }
}
```

In the new library version, `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been removed and replaced with `ResolverException`. Therefore, we need to replace all occurrences of `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` with `ResolverException`. Additionally, we need to update the method signature of the `execute()` method to reflect the new exception type. We can do this by wrapping the `super.execute()` call in a try-catch block and throwing a new `MojoExecutionException` with the original exception as its cause.

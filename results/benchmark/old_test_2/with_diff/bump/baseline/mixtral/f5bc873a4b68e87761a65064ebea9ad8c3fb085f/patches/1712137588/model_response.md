Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

--

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    try {
        super.execute();
    } catch (ResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to resolve dependencies", e);
    }
}
```

The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been removed in the new library version, so we replace it with the new exception class `ResolverException`. We also wrap the `super.execute()` call in a try-catch block to catch any `ResolverException` that might be thrown and re-throw it as a `MojoExecutionException`.

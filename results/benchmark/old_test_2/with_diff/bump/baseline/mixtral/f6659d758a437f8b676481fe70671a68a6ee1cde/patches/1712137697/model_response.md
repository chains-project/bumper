Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml(TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector) {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(trustedTagInspector);
    // ...
    return yaml;
}
```
In this patch, we remove the direct import of `TrustedTagInspector` and instead include it as a parameter of the `createYaml` method. This way, we can still use `TrustedTagInspector` in the method implementation, but we no longer rely on it being imported directly.

Note that we can't simply remove the import statement because the method still needs to accept a `TrustedTagInspector` as a parameter. However, we can remove the `@Override` decorator from the method if it's not actually overriding any method in the new version.

Also note that we can't use any of the removed methods identified with `--`, but we can use any of the added methods identified with `++`. However, in this case, we don't need to use any of the added methods.

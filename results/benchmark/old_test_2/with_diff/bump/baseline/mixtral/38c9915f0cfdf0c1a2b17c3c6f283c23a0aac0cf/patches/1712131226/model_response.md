Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.Texts;

// ...

new JoinedText(Texts.wrap("some-text"))
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `JoinedText` cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.text` package. This suggests that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the library.

To fix the error, we can use the `Texts` class instead, which provides a `join()` method that can be used to join a collection of `CharSequence` objects into a single `String`. The `Texts.wrap()` method can be used to convert a `String` into a `Text` object, which can then be passed to the `join()` method.

In this patch, we create a `Text` object from the string "some-text" using `Texts.wrap()`, and then pass it to the `join()` method to create a `JoinedText` object. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

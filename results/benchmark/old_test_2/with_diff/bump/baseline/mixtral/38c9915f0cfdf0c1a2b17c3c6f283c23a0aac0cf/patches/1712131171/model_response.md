Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Texts;

// ...

@Override
public String wallets(String user) throws IOException {
  List<String> wallets = new ArrayList<>();
  // ...
  return new JoinedText(Texts.length(wallets), "\n").multiJoin(wallets);
}
```

In this patch, we're using the `Texts` class from the same library instead of `JoinedText`, which was removed in the new version. The `Texts` class provides a `length` method that returns the length of a collection of texts, which we can use to create a `JoinedText` object. The `multiJoin` method of `JoinedText` then concatenates all the texts in the collection with a newline character between each one.

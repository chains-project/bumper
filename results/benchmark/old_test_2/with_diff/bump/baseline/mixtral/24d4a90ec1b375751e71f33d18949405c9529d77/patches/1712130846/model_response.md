I cannot see the full code and error message, but based on the information you provided, it seems like the error is caused by a missing class or interface. Here's a suggestion for a patch that might fix the issue:
```java
import org.apache.http.client.methods.CloseableHttpResponse;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet;
import org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient;
import org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClients;
import org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils;

import java.io.IOException;

public class AwsOcketITCase {

    public void testGetObject() throws IOException {
        CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault();
        HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("http://s3.amazonaws.com/test-bucket/test-object");
        CloseableHttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpget);
        try {
            System.out.println(EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity()));
        } finally {
            response.close();
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses the Apache HttpClient library instead of the Lang3 library to make an HTTP GET request. The `CloseableHttpClient` and `CloseableHttpResponse` interfaces are used to handle the HTTP request and response, respectively. The `HttpGet` class is used to specify the HTTP method and URL for the request. The `EntityUtils` class is used to convert the response entity to a string.

Note that this code assumes that the error is caused by a missing class or interface in the Lang3 library. If the error is caused by a different issue, this code may not fix the problem. Additionally, this code may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of your application.

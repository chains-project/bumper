I've identified the issue and created a patch for the failing code. The error is caused because the `RandomStringUtils` class is no longer available in the new version of the library. I've replaced the usage of `RandomStringUtils` with a more up-to-date alternative, `StringUtils.randomString()`, from the same library.

Here's the patched code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.randomString;

// ...

@Test
@Override
public void testS3BucketCreation() {
    String bucketName = randomString(10) + "-test-bucket-" + UUID.randomUUID();
    // ...
}
```

This patch should resolve the error and make the code compile successfully with the new library version.

Sure, based on the error message and the library changes, it seems that the `Storages` class has been removed and replaced with `StoragesLoader`. Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    try {
        StoragesLoader storages = new StoragesLoader();
        return new YamlPolicy(
            new BlockingStorage(
                storages.newObject(
                    sub.string("type"), Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping()
                )
            )
        );
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we create a new instance of `StoragesLoader` and use its `newObject` method to create a new `Storage` object, instead of using the `Storages` class. Note that we no longer need to specify the class of the `Config` object, as the `newObject` method can infer it from the first argument.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. This suggests that the `com.jcabi.aspects` package has been removed in the new library version.

To fix this error, we can remove the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead apply the `@Tv` annotation directly to the class. This way, we can still use the annotation without relying on the `com.jcabi.aspects` package.

Note that we are using the `@Tv` annotation with the same arguments as before (`{1, 2, 3}`). This ensures that the behavior of the annotation remains unchanged.

Additionally, we have changed the import statement for `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` to match the new library version. This ensures that the `Ssh` and `Ssh.ByPassword` classes are still available for use in the code.

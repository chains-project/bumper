Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. This suggests that the `com.jcabi:jcabi-aspects` dependency has been removed or changed in a way that breaks compatibility with the client code.

To fix the error, we can remove the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and replace it with the annotation `@Tv` directly on the class definition. This assumes that the `@Tv` annotation has been moved or copied to a different package that is still available in the new library version.

Note that we cannot be sure that this patch will work without more information about the library changes. However, it should at least allow the client code to compile without errors related to the `Tv` symbol.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new SshByPassword("user", "password", "host");
        // ... continue using the Ssh object as before ...
    }
}
```
In this patch, I've imported `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`, since the `Tv` class is no longer available in the updated library version. I've also changed the type of the `ssh` variable to `Ssh` and created a new `Ssh` object using the `SshByPassword` constructor.

Note that the `@Tv` annotation is still present, but it's not used by the library anymore. You can remove it if you want, but I've left it in case it's still needed for some other purpose.

Also note that I've assumed that the `SshByPassword` constructor takes three arguments: a `String` for the username, a `String` for the password, and a `String` for the host. You may need to adjust the constructor arguments based on your specific use case.

Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
@Test
void shouldPullPushedByTag() throws Exception {
    this.client.run("push", this.image.remote());
    this.client.run("image", "rm", this.image.name());
    this.client.run("image", "rm", this.image.remote());
    String output = this.client.run("pull", this.image.remote());
    boolean containsDownloadedNewerImage = output.contains(
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", this.image.remote())
    );
    Assert.assertFalse("Newer image was not expected", containsDownloadedNewerImage);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` method call with an `Assert.assertFalse` method call, and replaced the `StringContains` matcher with a manual check using the `contains` method of the `String` class. This way, the code can work with the new version of the library.

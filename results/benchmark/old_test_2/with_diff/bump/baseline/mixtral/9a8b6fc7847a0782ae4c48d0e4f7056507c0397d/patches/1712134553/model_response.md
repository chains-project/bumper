Sure, here's a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEStringEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.digest.StringDigester;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.encoding.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder getPbePasswordEncoder() {
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(pbePassword);
    PBEStringEncryptor pbeStringEncryptor = new PBEStringEncryptor();
    pbeStringEncryptor.setAlgorithm(pbeAlgorithm);
    pbeStringEncryptor.setPassword(pbePassword);
    pbeStringEncryptor.setProviderName(pbeProviderName);
    StringDigester stringDigester = new StringDigester();
    stringDigester.setAlgorithm(stringDigesterAlgorithm);
    PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    passwordEncryptor.setAlgorithm(passwordEncryptorAlgorithm);
    PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(
        textEncryptor,
        pbeStringEncryptor,
        stringDigester,
        passwordEncryptor,
        passwordEncoder
    );
}
```
The changes I made include:

* Importing the necessary new classes from the updated library
* Creating new instances of the necessary classes from the updated library
* Creating a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance using the new constructor that takes in the necessary instances of the new classes from the updated library

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the values of certain variables (e.g. `pbePassword`, `pbeAlgorithm`, etc.) since they were not provided in the original code snippet. Please adjust the code accordingly based on your specific use case.

Sure, here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.jasypt.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder createPasswordEncoder() {
    PBEPasswordEncoder encoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor();
    encoder.setTextEncryptor(textEncryptor);
    return encoder;
}
```
In this patch, we're importing the new package for `PBEPasswordEncoder` and `TextEncryptor`. We're also creating a new `TextEncryptor` object and setting it as the text encryptor for the `PBEPasswordEncoder` object. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

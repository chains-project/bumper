Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.runner.JUnitCore;
import org.junit.runner.Result;
import org.junit.runner.notification.Failure;

@Ignore
public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    public void testSomething() {
        JUnitCore junit = new JUnitCore();
        Result result = junit.run(FastPolygonizerTests.class);
        for (Failure failure : result.getFailures()) {
            System.out.println(failure.toString());
        }
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `Ignore` annotation with the `@Ignore` annotation, which is a valid way to ignore a test method in JUnit 4.

Note that I had to import some additional classes (`JUnitCore`, `Result`, and `Failure`) to implement this solution. These classes are part of the JUnit library, and they provide the necessary functionality to run and report the results of a test method.

Also, note that I did not make any changes to the `testSomething` method signature. I only added a few lines of code to run the test method and report the results.

Finally, note that I did not use any of the removed library methods (indicated with `--`). Instead, I used only the added library methods (indicated with `++`).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

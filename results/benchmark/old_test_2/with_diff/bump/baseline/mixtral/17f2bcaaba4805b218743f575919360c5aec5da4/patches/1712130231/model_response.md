Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
    ignore("some message");
    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `ignore` method from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`. We then use this method in the test method to ignore the test case, as a replacement for the `@Ignore` annotation.

Note that this patch assumes that the test framework being used is JUnit 5 or later. If the framework is an earlier version of JUnit, then a different approach may be needed.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
    ignore("some message");
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Ignore` cannot be found in the `org.junit` package, which suggests that the client code is using JUnit 4 syntax for ignoring tests. However, the updated library version is using JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5), which requires a different syntax for ignoring tests.

To fix the error, we can replace the `@Ignore` annotation with a static import of `ignore` from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`. This method takes a message as an argument and can be used to ignore a test in JUnit Jupiter.

Note that the `@Override` annotation can be safely removed from the `testSomething` method since it's not overriding any method in the new version.

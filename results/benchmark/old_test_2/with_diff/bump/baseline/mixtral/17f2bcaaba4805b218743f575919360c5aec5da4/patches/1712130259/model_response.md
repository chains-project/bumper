Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
    ignore("some message");
    // ...
}
```
In the new version of JUnit, the `@Ignore` annotation has been replaced by the `ignore` method in the `Assertions` class. This method can be used to ignore a specific test case. In the example above, the `ignore` method is called with a message indicating why the test case is being ignored. This should fix the error message and allow the test case to be executed.

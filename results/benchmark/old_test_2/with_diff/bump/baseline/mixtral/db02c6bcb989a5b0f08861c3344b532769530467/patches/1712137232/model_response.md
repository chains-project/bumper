Sure, here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
@Test
void shouldPush() throws Exception {
    final Image original = new Image.ForOs();
    final String image = this.copy(original);
    final String output = this.cli.run("push", image);
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        output,
        new StringContains("latest: digest: " + original.digest())
    );
}
```
In this patch, I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it is not needed and is causing the error. The `StringContains` constructor only requires a single argument, which is the expected substring.

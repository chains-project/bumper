Here's the fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp fromSql = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp toSql = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(fromSql, toSql).getTime());
}
```

I created two new variables `fromSql` and `toSql` of type `java.sql.Timestamp` to store the converted `Date` objects. Then, I used these new variables to call the added library method `between(java.sql.Timestamp, java.sql.Timestamp)`. Finally, I created a new `Timestamp` object using the result of the library method.

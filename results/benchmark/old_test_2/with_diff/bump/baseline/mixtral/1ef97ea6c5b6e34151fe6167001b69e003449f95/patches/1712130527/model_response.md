Based on the error message and the library changes, it seems that the `between` method of the external dependency now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. Therefore, you can fix the error by changing the return type of the `between` method in the client code to `java.sql.Timestamp`.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

Note that this code still uses the deprecated `java.sql.Timestamp(long)` constructor, which is not recommended in general. However, since the method signature cannot be changed and the `java.sql.Timestamp` class does not have a constructor that takes a `java.util.Date` argument, this is the best solution that preserves the original behavior of the code.

Based on the error message and the library changes, it seems that the `between` method of the external dependency now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. Therefore, you can fix the error by changing the return type of the `between` method and the type of the variable that stores the result of the `super.between` method.

Here is the fixed code:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = super.between(from, to);
  return new Timestamp(timestamp.getTime());
}
```

This code creates a new variable `timestamp` of type `java.sql.Timestamp` to store the result of `super.between` method. Then, it creates a new `Timestamp` object by passing the time in milliseconds from the `timestamp` variable. This ensures that the code is compatible with the new library version.

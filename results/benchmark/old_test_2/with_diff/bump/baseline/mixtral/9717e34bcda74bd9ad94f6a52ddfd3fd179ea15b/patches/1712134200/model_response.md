Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.NULL)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the problematic import statement with a new import statement that imports the `Loggable` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, using the `Loggable.NULL` constant as its argument.

Note that we cannot use the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, as it has been removed in the new library version. However, we can still use other classes and methods from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, such as the `Loggable` annotation.

By using the `Loggable` annotation, we ensure that the `MkGithub` class remains compatible with the new library version, while also fixing the compilation error caused by the missing `Tv` class.

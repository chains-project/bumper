Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which was previously applied to individual methods using the `Tv` aspect. This should fix the error and provide similar functionality to the original code.

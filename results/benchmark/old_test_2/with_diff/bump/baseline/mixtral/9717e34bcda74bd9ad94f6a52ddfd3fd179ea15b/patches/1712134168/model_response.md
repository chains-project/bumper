Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the problematic import statement with a new import for the `Loggable` class from the same `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We also add the `@Loggable` annotation to the `MkGithub` class.

Note that the `Tv` class has been removed in the updated library version, so we cannot use it directly. However, the `Loggable` class provides similar functionality for logging, so it can be used as a replacement.

This patch assumes that the original `MkGithub` class was not overriding any methods from the `Tv` class. If it was, then additional changes may be necessary to ensure that the class still functions correctly.

Here's a fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. I also added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, which is a replacement for the removed `@Tv` annotation. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile with the updated library version.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation to use the new logging functionality. Note that we removed the `Override` decorator since the `MkGithub` class is not overriding any method in the new version.

Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

...

@Override
public void decode(ChannelBuffer buffer) throws TlsFatalAlert {
    short type = buffer.readUnsignedByte();
    short length = buffer.readUnsignedShort();
    if (length < 1) {
        throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.decode(type));
    }
    byte[] payload = new byte[length - 1];
    buffer.readBytes(payload);
    // use the new method to get the alert description
    AlertDescription alertDescription = new TlsFatalAlert(type).getAlertDescription();
    // rest of the method implementation
}
```
In this patch, we import the new `TlsFatalAlert` class from the updated library version and use its `getAlertDescription()` method to get the `AlertDescription` object. We also remove the unused `--` methods from the code.

Note that we do not modify the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as the method is still overriding a method in the new version. We also do not use any removed library methods, and we do not modify the behavior of the method beyond what is necessary to fix the compilation error.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public AlertDescription getAlertDescription(short alert) {
    return new TlsFatalAlert(alert).getAlertDescription();
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package is not found, which suggests that the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor that takes a `short` as an argument is no longer available. However, the `TlsFatalAlert` class is still present and has a method `getAlertDescription()` that returns an `AlertDescription` object. Therefore, we can create a new `TlsFatalAlert` object with the given alert code and call `getAlertDescription()` on it to get the corresponding `AlertDescription`. This should fix the error while preserving the original method signature.

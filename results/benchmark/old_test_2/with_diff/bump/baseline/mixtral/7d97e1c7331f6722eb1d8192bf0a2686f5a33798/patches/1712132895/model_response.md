Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `Tv` class is not found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. Based on the library changes, it seems that the `Tv` class has been removed in the new version. Instead, we can use the `Immutable` aspect from the same package to achieve similar functionality. By annotating the `RegionITCase` class with `@Immutable`, we ensure that it cannot be modified once it is created.

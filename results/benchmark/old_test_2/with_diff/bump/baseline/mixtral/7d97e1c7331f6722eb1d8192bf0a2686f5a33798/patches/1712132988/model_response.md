Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. We then annotate the `RegionITCase` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which was previously used with the `Tv` aspect but can now be used directly.

Note that this patch assumes that the behavior of the original code was not heavily dependent on the `Tv` aspect, but rather used it for logging or debugging purposes. If the `Tv` aspect was used for more complex behavior, a different approach may be necessary.

Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we've replaced the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable` from the same `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We've also added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `RegionITCase` class to use the newly imported class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Loggable` class is a suitable replacement for the `Tv` class in this context. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the code further to use a different class or method from the updated library.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.INFO)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. After checking the library changes, we can see that the `Tv` class has been removed. Therefore, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality.

In this case, the `Tv` class was used to enable logging. We can use the `Loggable` aspect instead, which has been added in the new library version. By annotating the class with `@Loggable(Loggable.INFO)`, we can enable logging for the class.

Note: The actual logging level (e.g., `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, etc.) can be adjusted based on the desired logging behavior.

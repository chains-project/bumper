Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a new addition in the updated library version. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error for the `Tv` class. Additionally, we add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, which will enable logging for the test case. Note that the `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect, as both are used for adding aspects to methods.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class RegionITCase {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Immutable` from the same `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We then annotate the `RegionITCase` class with the `@Immutable` annotation, which is a replacement for the removed `@Tv` annotation.

Note that the `@Immutable` annotation is a new addition in the updated library version, so we are allowed to use it. Additionally, the `@Immutable` annotation does not affect the method signature or functionality of the `RegionITCase` class, so it is a suitable replacement for the removed `@Tv` annotation.

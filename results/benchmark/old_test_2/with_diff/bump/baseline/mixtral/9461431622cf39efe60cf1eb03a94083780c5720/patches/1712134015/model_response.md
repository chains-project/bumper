Here is a possible patch for the given code:
```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOGroup>> reg = new TreeMap<>();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```
The main change is the type of the `reg` variable, which is now explicitly declared as `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOGroup>>`. This is necessary because the `ManagedObject` class in the new library version is generic, and the type parameter must be specified.

I also changed the type of the `reg` variable to be consistent with the type of the `registry` field, which is `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOGroup>>`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `server` field is of type `DefaultMOServer`, and that the `registerHard` method is not overriding any method in the new version. If these assumptions are incorrect, the patch may not work as expected.

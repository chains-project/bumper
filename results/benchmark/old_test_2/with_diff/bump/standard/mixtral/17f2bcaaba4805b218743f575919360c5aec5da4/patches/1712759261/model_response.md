Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import micycle.pgs.annotations.Ignore; // add this import statement

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
@micycle.pgs.annotations.Ignore // use the fully qualified name here
void testRobustnessRandomly() {
    // ... the rest of the method remains unchanged ...
}
```
The failure is caused by the missing import statement for the `Ignore` annotation, which is now located in the `micycle.pgs.annotations` package instead of the top-level `micycle.pgs` package. By adding the import statement and using the fully qualified name for the annotation, the code should compile and run without errors.

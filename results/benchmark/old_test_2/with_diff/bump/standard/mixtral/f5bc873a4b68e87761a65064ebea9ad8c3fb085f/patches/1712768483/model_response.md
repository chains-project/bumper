Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.DefaultProjectBuilder;
import org.apache.maven.project.ProjectBuilder;
import org.apache.maven.project.ProjectBuildingException;

// ...

private MavenProject getMavenProject() throws ProjectBuildingException {
    ProjectBuilder projectBuilder = new DefaultProjectBuilder();
    Model model = projectBuilder.build( project, null ).getModel();
    return new MavenProject( model );
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` class is not found. This suggests that the `maven-project` module, which contains this class, is either missing or not included in the classpath.

To fix this issue, I have imported the `ProjectBuilder` class from the `maven-project` module, which can be used to build a `MavenProject` instance from a `Model` object. The `Model` object can be built using the `ProjectBuilder` instance, and the `MavenProject` instance can be created from the `Model` object. This allows the original functionality of the `getMavenProject` method to be preserved, while avoiding the use of the `MavenProject` class directly.

Note: This patch assumes that the `project` variable used in the original code is an instance of the `String` class, representing the path to the project's `pom.xml` file. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProjectBuilder;
import org.apache.maven.project.ProjectBuilderConfiguration;
import org.apache.maven.project.ProjectBuildingException;

//...

MavenProject mavenProject = null;
try {
    ProjectBuilderConfiguration config = new ProjectBuilderConfiguration();
    MavenProjectBuilder builder = new MavenProjectBuilder();
    mavenProject = builder.build(projectFile, config);
} catch (ProjectBuildingException e) {
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to build Maven project", e);
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` class cannot be found, which suggests that the `maven-project` dependency may have been removed or changed in a way that breaks compatibility.

To fix this issue, we can use the `MavenProjectBuilder` class to build a `MavenProject` object instead of directly instantiating it. This approach is more flexible and less prone to compatibility issues.

Note that this patch assumes that the `projectFile` variable is already defined and contains the path to the Maven project file. You may need to adjust the code accordingly.

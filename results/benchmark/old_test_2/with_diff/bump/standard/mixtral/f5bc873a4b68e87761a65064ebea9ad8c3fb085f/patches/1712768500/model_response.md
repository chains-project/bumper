Here is a patched version of the failing method that uses the added `MavenSession` class instead of the removed `MavenProject` class:

```java
import org.apache.maven.execution.MavenSession;

// ...

public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
    // Get the Maven session object
    MavenSession session = (MavenSession) getContext().getAttribute( "session" );

    // Use the session object to get the current project
    MavenProject project = session.getCurrentProject();

    // Continue with the rest of the method using the `project` variable
    // ...
}
```
Note that this code assumes that the `getContext()` method still exists and returns the same type of object as before. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Here is a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo).getTime());
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects `from` and `to` to `Timestamp` objects `sqlFrom` and `sqlTo`, respectively. It then calls the `between` method of the superclass with these `Timestamp` objects. Finally, it creates a new `Timestamp` object with the time value returned by the superclass's `between` method.

This patch is necessary because the superclass's `between` method now expects `Timestamp` objects as arguments, rather than `Date` objects. By converting the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects, we can call the superclass's `between` method without causing a type error.

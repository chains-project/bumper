Here is the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This patch should fix the error by casting the result of `super.between(from, to)` to `java.sql.Timestamp`:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(((Timestamp) super.between(from, to)).getTime());
}
```

This is necessary because the new version of the library has removed the `DateAndTime.between(Date, Date)` method and replaced it with `DateAndTime.between(Timestamp, Timestamp)`. Therefore, the result of `super.between(from, to)` is now a `Timestamp` object, not a `Date` object.

Note that this patch does not change the function signature, and it does not use any removed library methods. It only adds a cast to the result of `super.between(from, to)` to ensure that it is of the correct type.

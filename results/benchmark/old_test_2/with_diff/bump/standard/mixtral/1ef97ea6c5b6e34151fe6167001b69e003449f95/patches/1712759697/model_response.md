Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime())).getTime());
}
```
This patch converts the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before passing them to the `super.between()` method, to ensure that the return type is compatible with `Timestamp`.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime())).getTime());
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before passing them to the superclass's `between` method. This ensures that the returned value is also a `Timestamp`, which can be assigned to a `Timestamp` variable without causing a type mismatch error.

Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertToTimestamp(super.between(convertToTimestamp(from), convertToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

This patch introduces a new helper method `convertToTimestamp` that converts a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object. The `between` method is then updated to use this helper method to convert the input dates and the result of the superclass's `between` method to `Timestamp` objects. This allows the method to use the new `between` method added in the updated library that returns a `Timestamp` object.

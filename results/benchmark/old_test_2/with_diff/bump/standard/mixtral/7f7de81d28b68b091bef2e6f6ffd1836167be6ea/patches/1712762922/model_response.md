Here is a fixed version of the `registerHard` method that should resolve the type compatibility issue:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        final Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes I made are:

1. I changed the type of the `reg` variable from `SortedMap` to the raw type `Map`. This is safe because the `put` method of the raw type `Map` has the same effect as the `put` method of `SortedMap`.
2. I changed the type of the value returned by `server.getRegistry()` from `SortedMap` to the raw type `Map`. This is safe because the `put` method of the raw type `Map` has the same effect as the `put` method of `SortedMap`.
3. I changed the type of the argument passed to `registry.set(server, reg)` from `SortedMap` to a `TreeMap`, which is a concrete implementation of `SortedMap`. This is safe because the `TreeMap` constructor accepts a `Map` as an argument and creates a new `TreeMap` that contains the same mappings as the argument.

These changes should resolve the type compatibility issue and allow the `registerHard` method to compile and run without errors.

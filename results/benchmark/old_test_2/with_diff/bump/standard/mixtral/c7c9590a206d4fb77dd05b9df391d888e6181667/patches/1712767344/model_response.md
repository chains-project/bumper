Here is a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.lang.String;

RenderingContext renderingContext = new ...; // initialize the rendering context using appropriate constructor
String outputName = renderingContext.getOutputName();
...
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist, which suggests that the class `RenderingContext` has been moved to a different package.
The changes listed in the new library version indicate that `RenderingContext` is now directly under `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer` package.
Therefore, we can import `RenderingContext` directly from the new package and create an instance of it using an appropriate constructor.
Since the method `getOutputName()` is still available in the new version, we can use it to get the output name of the rendering context.
The rest of the code can remain the same, assuming it does not rely on any removed methods or classes.

Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.io.StringWriter;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext object
        // For example, you can return a constant value or a value based on the current state of the program
        return "xhtml";
    }
};

StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();

// Use the new renderingContext and stringWriter objects in the rest of the method
// ...
```
This patch creates a new anonymous class that extends `RenderingContext` and overrides the `getOutputName()` method. This method is added in the new version of the library, and it is called in the original client code. By overriding this method, we can provide a value for it and avoid the compilation error.

The patch also creates a new `StringWriter` object, which can be used as a replacement for the `Writer` object that is passed to the `renderDocument()` method. This allows us to capture the output of the method and use it for further processing.

Note that this patch may need to be adjusted based on the specific usage of the `RenderingContext` object in the original client code. For example, if the `RenderingContext` object is used to store state or pass information between different parts of the program, you may need to add additional fields or methods to the anonymous class to preserve this behavior.

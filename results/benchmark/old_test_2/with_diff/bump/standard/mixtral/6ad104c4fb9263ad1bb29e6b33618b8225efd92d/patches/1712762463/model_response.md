Here is a proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
import java.lang.Short;
import java.util.EnumSet;
import java.util.Set;

import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // existing code...

    private Set<TlsFatalAlert> getAlertSet(Short alertCode) {
        return EnumSet.of(TlsFatalAlert.valueOf(alertCode));
    }

    // existing code...
}
```

This patch imports the new `TlsFatalAlert` class, and defines a new helper method `getAlertSet` that takes a `Short` argument representing the alert code, and returns a set containing the corresponding `TlsFatalAlert` instance. This method uses the new `TlsFatalAlert.valueOf` method to convert the alert code to a `TlsFatalAlert` instance.

Note that the `EnumSet` class is used here to create a set containing the `TlsFatalAlert` instance. This is because `TlsFatalAlert` is an enum type, and `EnumSet` is a specialized set implementation for enum types that provides good performance characteristics.

Also note that the `EnumSet.of` method is used here to create a set containing a single element. This method takes a variable number of arguments representing the elements to include in the set.

Finally, note that the `valueOf` method is used here instead of the `getAlertDescription` method that was removed in the new library version. This is because the `getValue` method returns the numeric value of the alert code, which is what is needed here. The `getAlertDescription` method, on the other hand, returns the corresponding alert description string, which is not what is needed here.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
This patch removes the `super.between(from, to).getTime()` call and instead calls the `between` method directly on the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime` class. This is possible because the `between` method in the `DateAndTime` class has been updated to return a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which is compatible with the return type of the `between` method in the `DateTime` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime` class is available in the classpath. If this class is not available, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

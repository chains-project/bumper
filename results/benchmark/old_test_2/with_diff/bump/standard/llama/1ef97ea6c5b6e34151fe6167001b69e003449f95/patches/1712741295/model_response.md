Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
Becomes:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
The patch replaces the call to `super.between(from, to)` with a call to `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to)`, which is the new method added in the updated library version. This should fix the incompatible types error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

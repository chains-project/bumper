Here's a possible patch to fix the failure:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(false, () -> java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
The patch creates a lambda expression that formats the string using `String.format()` and passes it to the `StringContains` constructor. This avoids the issue of passing a boolean and a string to the constructor, which is not allowed due to the removal of the varargs method in the updated library version.

Note that the lambda expression is used to create a function that returns a string, which is then passed to the `StringContains` constructor. This is a common pattern in Java 8 and later versions, where lambdas are used to create functions that can be passed around as arguments or returned as values.

This patch should fix the failure and allow the code to compile and run correctly with the updated library version.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```diff
-@java.lang.Override
-@com.jcabi.aspects.RetryOnFailure(attempts = Tv.SEVEN, delay = 1, unit = java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MINUTES, verbose = false, types = java.io.IOException.class)
+@java.lang.Override
+@com.jcabi.aspects.RetryOnFailure(attempts = 7, delay = 1, unit = java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MINUTES, verbose = false, types = java.io.IOException.class)
protected com.jcraft.jsch.Session session() throws java.io.IOException {
    // ...
```
The patch removes the reference to the `Tv` constant, which is not available in the updated library version, and replaces it with the literal value `7`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` constant was used only in this one place in the code. If it's used elsewhere, the patch would need to be adjusted accordingly.

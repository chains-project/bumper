Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```diff
-        return new org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
+        return new org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").test(s);
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `apply` method has been removed from the `org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder` class. To fix this, we can replace the `apply` method call with a call to the `test` method, which has the same behavior.

The `test` method takes a `java.lang.String` argument and returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the given string matches the filter. In this case, we can use it instead of `apply` to check whether the given `s` matches the filter.

Note that we're using the `test` method instead of the `apply` method, because the `apply` method has been removed in the new version of the library.

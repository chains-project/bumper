Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Replace the import with the following line
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Add the following line at the end of the file
MavenProject project = new MavenProject();
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.project` does not exist. This is likely because the dependency on the Maven Project API has been removed in the new library version. To fix this issue, we can create a new instance of the `MavenProject` class and use it instead of the imported class. This will ensure that the code continues to work even if the dependency is removed.

Note that this patch assumes that the `MavenProject` class is still available in the new library version. If the class has been removed entirely, a different approach may be necessary.

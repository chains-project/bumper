Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Replace the import with a reference to the updated version of the library
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Create a variable to reference the updated version of the library
MavenProject updatedMavenProject = new MavenProject();

// Modify the code to use the updated version of the library
updatedMavenProject.setGroupId("myfaces-tobago");
updatedMavenProject.setArtifactId("tobago-theme-plugin");
updatedMavenProject.setVersion("1.0");
```
This patch imports the updated version of the `MavenProject` class and creates a variable to reference it. It then modifies the code to use the updated version of the library by setting the `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` properties of the `MavenProject` object.

Note that this patch assumes that the updated version of the library has the same methods and fields as the original version, and that the changes made to the library do not break the compatibility with the client code. If the updated version of the library has breaking changes, additional modifications may be required to the client code to make it compatible with the new version.

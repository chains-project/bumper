It seems like the import statement is causing the error. The compiler is unable to find the symbol `Tv` in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. 

This could be due to a few reasons: 

1. The `Tv` class does not exist in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package.
2. The `com.jcabi.aspects` package does not exist in the classpath.

The solution would be to remove the import statement if the `Tv` class is not used in the code or replace it with the correct import statement if the `Tv` class is located in a different package.

As I cannot see the rest of the code, I cannot suggest a specific replacement for the import statement. However, if the `Tv` class is not used in the code, the fixed code would look like this:

```java
  // import statement removed
```

If the `Tv` class is used in the code and is located in a different package, you would need to replace the import statement with the correct one. For example, if the `Tv` class is located in the `com.jcabi.otherpackage` package, the fixed code would look like this:

```java
  import com.jcabi.otherpackage.Tv;
```

Please replace `com.jcabi.otherpackage` with the actual package where the `Tv` class is located.

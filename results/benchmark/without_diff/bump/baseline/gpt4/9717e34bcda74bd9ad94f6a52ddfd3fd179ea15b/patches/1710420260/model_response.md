The error message suggests that the symbol `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could be due to several reasons such as the package not being present in the classpath, the class `Tv` being removed or renamed in a newer version of the package, or the package itself being deprecated or removed.

Since we can't change the external dependency, we have to modify the client code. If the `Tv` class was used for some utility functions, we can replace it with equivalent code in Java Standard Library or another library that is present in the classpath.

Unfortunately, without more information about the usage of `Tv` class in the code, I can't provide a specific patch. But here is a general way to replace the import statement:

```java
  // import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;
  // Replace with a class from Java Standard Library or another library that provides the required functionality.
```

Please replace the comment with the appropriate import statement based on the actual usage of `Tv` class in your code.

The error message suggests that the symbol 'Tv' from the package 'com.jcabi.aspects' cannot be found. This could be due to a couple of reasons:

1. The package 'com.jcabi.aspects' is not available in the classpath.
2. The 'Tv' class or interface does not exist in the 'com.jcabi.aspects' package.

As the task suggests that the failure is caused by an external dependency, it's likely that the 'Tv' class or interface has been removed or renamed in a newer version of the 'com.jcabi.aspects' library.

Unfortunately, without knowing what 'Tv' is used for in your code, it's impossible to suggest a precise fix. However, you can try to replace 'Tv' with an equivalent class or interface from the 'com.jcabi.aspects' package or another package. If 'Tv' cannot be replaced, you might need to rewrite the parts of your code that use 'Tv'.

For example, if 'Tv' is a utility class that provides a method 'a()', you can create a new utility class 'MyTv' with a similar method 'a()':

```java
public class MyTv {
    public static ReturnType a(ParamType param) {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```

Then, replace 'Tv.a()' with 'MyTv.a()' in your code. If 'Tv' is an interface, you can create a new interface 'MyTv' with the same methods:

```java
public interface MyTv {
    ReturnType method(ParamType param);
}
```

Then, replace 'Tv' with 'MyTv' in your code. If 'Tv' is a class, you can create a new class 'MyTv' with the same methods:

```java
public class MyTv {
    public ReturnType method(ParamType param) {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```

Then, replace 'Tv' with 'MyTv' in your code.

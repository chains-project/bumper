It seems like the import statement is failing because the symbol cannot be found. This might be because the Tv class in the com.jcabi.aspects package is not available. 

If the Tv class is not used in the code, you can simply remove the import statement. On the other hand, if it is used, you would need to replace it with the correct import statement or define the missing symbol in your code. 

Since you haven't provided the code where the Tv class is used, I can't provide a direct replacement. However, I can show you how to define a new Tv class in case it's used in your code:

```java
public class Tv {
    // Define the methods and variables used in your code
}
```

Please replace the methods and variables in the Tv class with the ones used in your code. If the Tv class is not used in your code, simply remove the import statement.

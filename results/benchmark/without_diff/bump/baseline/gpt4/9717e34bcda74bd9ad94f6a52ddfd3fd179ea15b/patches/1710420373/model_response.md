The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could be due to the class `Tv` being removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package or the package itself being removed.

If the class `Tv` or the package `com.jcabi.aspects` is no longer available, you'll need to replace the usage of `Tv` with equivalent functionality provided by another class or package.

However, without knowing the exact usage of `Tv` in your code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. Here's a general way to handle this situation. Replace the import statement with the new package and class that provides the same functionality:

```java
import com.newpackage.NewClass;
```

Please replace `com.newpackage.NewClass` with the actual package and class name that provides the same functionality as `Tv`.

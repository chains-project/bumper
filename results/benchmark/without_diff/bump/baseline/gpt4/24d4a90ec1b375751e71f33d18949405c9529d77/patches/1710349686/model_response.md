The error message indicates that the symbol cannot be found. This could mean that the library is not properly imported or the version of the library does not contain the symbol. 

However, as you have not provided the full client code or the specific class or method that is failing, it's hard to provide an accurate patch. 

But generally, if the problem is with the import statement, you may try to replace it with the correct import statement. 

If `Tv` class is not available in `com.jcabi.aspects`, then it's necessary to find out the correct package where this class is available. 

If `Tv` class is removed from the new version of `com.jcabi.aspects`, then you should find an alternative way to achieve the functionality provided by `Tv` class.

If you are sure that `Tv` class is in `com.jcabi.aspects` package and the error is due to the incorrect setup, then you should check the project setup, library path, and make sure the correct version of `com.jcabi.aspects` is added to the project.

Without exact details about the `Tv` class or the usage of `Tv` class in your code, it's hard to provide a concrete solution. Please provide more details.

Based on the information provided, it seems like the import statement `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;` is causing the error. This could be due to the Tv class not being present in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package or the package might not be present in the classpath. 

Unfortunately, without more specific details on the usage of this import in your code, it's hard to provide a precise fix. However, I can suggest a general approach. You can try to replace this import with an alternative or remove it if it's not used in your code.

If `Tv` class was used for some functionality in your code, you might need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality. If it was used for time conversion, you can use `java.time` package which is a part of Java SE 8 and later.

However, without more context, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. Please provide more details about how the `Tv` class is being used in your code.

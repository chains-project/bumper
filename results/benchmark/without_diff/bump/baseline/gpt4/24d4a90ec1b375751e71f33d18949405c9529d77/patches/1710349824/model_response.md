The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` is not found. This could be due to the fact that the library is not properly imported or the library doesn't contain the symbol `Tv`.

If the library doesn't contain the symbol `Tv` anymore, we have to replace the usage of `Tv` with an equivalent functionality from the library or from Java itself. However, without the context where `Tv` is used, it's hard to propose a specific solution.

If the error is due to the fact that the library is not properly imported, we have to make sure that the library `com.jcabi.aspects` is added to the project dependencies. This is usually done in the build file of the project (like pom.xml for Maven projects or build.gradle for Gradle projects).

Since the task mentions that the failure is caused by an external dependency and the fix should be done in the client code, I assume that the library `com.jcabi.aspects` has been updated and doesn't contain `Tv` anymore. Therefore, I will propose a general solution that replaces `Tv` with a simple constant. 

Please replace the usage of `Tv` with a constant in your code. For example, if `Tv` was a constant integer, you could replace it with:

```java
  final int Tv = 10; // replace 10 with the actual value of Tv
```

This is a general solution and might not work in your specific case. Please provide more context for a more accurate solution.

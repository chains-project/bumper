It seems like the package `org.cactoos.text.TrimmedText` is not found. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the package is not installed or the package is installed but not properly linked. 

However, as a software engineer, you can't control the external dependencies. The only thing you can control is your own code. So, let's try to replace the `TrimmedText` with Java's built-in `trim()`. 

Here is the updated code:

```java
  import java.lang.String;
```

Here, we are using Java's built-in `String` class which has a `trim()` method which can be used to trim the text. This should resolve the error.

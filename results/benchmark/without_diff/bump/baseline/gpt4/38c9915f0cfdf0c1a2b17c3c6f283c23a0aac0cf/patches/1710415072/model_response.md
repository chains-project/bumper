The error message suggests that the symbol `SolidScalar` cannot be found in the package `org.cactoos.scalar`. This could mean that the class `SolidScalar` has been removed, renamed, or moved to a different package in the new version of the dependency.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the dependency, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. However, you can try one of the following general solutions:

1. If the class `SolidScalar` has been renamed or moved to a different package, you need to update the import statement with the new name or location.

2. If the class `SolidScalar` has been removed, you need to find an alternative class or method in the new version of the dependency that provides the same functionality.

3. If the class `SolidScalar` is no longer necessary, you can simply remove the import statement.

Here is an example for each case:

1. The class `SolidScalar` has been renamed to `StableScalar` and is still in the same package:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.StableScalar;
```

2. The class `SolidScalar` has been moved to a different package:
```java
import org.cactoos.newpackage.SolidScalar;
```

3. The class `SolidScalar` has been removed and replaced by a new class `AlternativeScalar`:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.AlternativeScalar;
```

4. The class `SolidScalar` is no longer necessary:
```java
// import statement removed
```

Please replace `StableScalar`, `newpackage`, and `AlternativeScalar` with the actual new class name, new package, or alternative class provided by the updated dependency.

```java
    /**
     * Generates SCoverage report.
     * 
     * @throws MojoExecutionException if unexpected problem occurs
     */
    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        if ( !canGenerateReport() )
        {
            getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
            return;
        }

        try
        {
            RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
            SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
            Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
            if (locale == null) {
                locale = Locale.ENGLISH;
            }
            generate( sink, locale );
        }
        catch ( MavenReportException e )
        {
            String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( locale ) + " report generation";
            throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
        }
    }
```
In the above code, I removed the Override decorator as it was causing the 'cannot find symbol' error, indicating that the method is not present in the parent class.
Also, I added a null check for the locale variable before passing it to the generate method and getName method as it can potentially cause NullPointerException if it's null.

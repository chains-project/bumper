It seems like the error message indicates that the symbol `TFastFramedTransport` cannot be found. This typically happens when the class or method is not available in the imported package or the import statement is incorrect.

As a senior software engineer, I would suggest checking the version of the `org.apache.thrift` dependency to ensure that it contains the `TFastFramedTransport` class. If the class has been removed or renamed in a newer version, you may need to downgrade to an older version or find an alternative class to use.

Without knowledge of the version changes or the availability of the `TFastFramedTransport` class, I can't provide a specific code patch. However, assuming that the class has been renamed to `TFramedTransport`, the corrected import statement would be:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
```

If the class is not available at all, you might need to change your code to use a different class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. Please check the documentation of the Apache Thrift library for more information.

The error message suggests that the symbol `TFastFramedTransport` cannot be found. This might be due to a wrong import statement or the class `TFastFramedTransport` is not available in the imported package. 

If `TFastFramedTransport` has been moved to a different package in the new version of the library, you would need to import it from the new package. 

Without knowing the exact new location of `TFastFramedTransport`, it's difficult to provide the exact patch. But, the patch would look something like this:

```java
import new.package.location.TFastFramedTransport;
```

Replace `new.package.location` with the actual new package where `TFastFramedTransport` is located. 

If `TFastFramedTransport` has been removed or renamed in the new version of the library, you would need to find an alternative class or method to achieve the same functionality. This would require more information about the functionality of the code and the changes in the new library version.

It seems like the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist in the current version of the library. You should import the correct package. Without knowing the exact structure of the new version of the library, it's impossible to give you a precise solution. But, you should replace the import statement with the correct one. For example, if the `AlertDescription` class has been moved to the `org.bouncycastle.crypto` package, the import statement should be:

```java
  import org.bouncycastle.crypto.AlertDescription;
```

Please replace the package name with the correct one based on the new library structure.

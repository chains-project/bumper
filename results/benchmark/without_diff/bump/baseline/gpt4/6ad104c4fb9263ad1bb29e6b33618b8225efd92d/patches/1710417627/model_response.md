It seems like the package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls doesn't exist in the classpath. This could be because the BouncyCastle library is not included in your project dependencies. 

You should add the BouncyCastle library to your project dependencies to solve this issue. If you are using Maven, you can add the following to your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.64</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
After adding the dependency, try to import the package again in your Java class:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```

If the problem still persists, it's possible that the class `AlertDescription` has been moved to a different package or has been renamed in the new version of the library. You should check the BouncyCastle library documentation or source code to find the new package or class name.

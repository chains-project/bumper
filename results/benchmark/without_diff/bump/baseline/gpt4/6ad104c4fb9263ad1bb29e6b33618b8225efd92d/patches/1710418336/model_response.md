It seems like the package 'org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls' does not exist in the classpath. This could be due to a few reasons such as the package is not available in the version of the library you are using or the library is not added to the classpath correctly. If the package is not available in the version of the library you are using, you might need to downgrade or upgrade the version of the library.

However, as per the constraints, we are not allowed to change the library or its version. So, we have to find an alternative way to solve this. 

One possible solution is to replace the import statement with the one that exists in the current version of the library. 

Since I don't know the exact version of the library you are using, I will provide a general solution. Replace the import statement with the one that exists in the current version of the library. If the 'TlsFatalAlert' class is moved to a different package, you should update the import statement accordingly. 

For example, if 'TlsFatalAlert' class is now available in 'org.bouncycastle.crypto' package, you should replace the import statement as follows:

```java
  import org.bouncycastle.crypto.TlsFatalAlert;
```

Please replace the package name with the correct one based on the version of the library you are using.

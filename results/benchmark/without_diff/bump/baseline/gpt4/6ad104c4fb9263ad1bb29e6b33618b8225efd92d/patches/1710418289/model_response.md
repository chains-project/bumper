It seems like the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist in your classpath. It's possible that the dependency for Bouncy Castle is either missing or outdated in your project.

If you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.68</version>
</dependency>
```

Otherwise, you should manually download the latest Bouncy Castle JAR and add it to your project classpath.

After adding the dependency, you should be able to import the TlsFatalAlert class without any issues:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```

If the `TlsFatalAlert` class is still not found, it could be that the class has been removed or renamed in the latest version of Bouncy Castle. In this case, you would need to find an alternative class or method to use. Without knowing more about your use of `TlsFatalAlert`, I can't provide a more specific solution.

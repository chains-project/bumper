The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could mean that the package or the class `Tv` does not exist, or it is not correctly imported.

Since we can't change the external dependencies, one possible solution is to replace the usage of `Tv` with equivalent Java code. However, without knowing the exact usage of `Tv` in your code, it's hard to provide an accurate solution. 

Assuming `Tv` is used for time conversion (based on its usage in some jcabi projects), and if it's used to convert minutes to milliseconds (a common usage), you can replace it with the following code:

```java
  int minutes = 5; // replace with actual value
  long milliseconds = TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(minutes);
```

Replace `Tv` with the above code where it's used in your project. If `Tv` is used for other purposes, you would need to replace it with corresponding Java code.

Please provide more context (like how `Tv` is used) if you need a more accurate solution.

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could be due to a few reasons such as:

1. The `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package.
2. The `Tv` class has been moved to a different package.
3. The `com.jcabi.aspects` package is not correctly added to the classpath.

Since the task specifies that the failure is caused by an external dependency, it's likely that the `Tv` class has been removed or moved to a different package. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. However, a general approach to resolving this issue would be to:

1. Check the latest version of the `com.jcabi.aspects` package and see if the `Tv` class has been removed or moved to a different package. If it has been moved, update the import statement with the correct package. If it has been removed, you will need to find an alternative class or method to replace its functionality.

2. If the `Tv` class is still present in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, ensure that the package is correctly added to the classpath. This could involve updating the project's build configuration or the IDE settings.

Please refer to the documentation or the latest changes of `com.jcabi.aspects` package to find the correct solution.

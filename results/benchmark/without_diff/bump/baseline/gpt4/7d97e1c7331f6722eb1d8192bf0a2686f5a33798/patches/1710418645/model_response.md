The error message indicates that the symbol for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` cannot be found. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the `Tv` class being removed or relocated in a newer version of the `jcabi-aspects` library, or the library not being properly included in the project.

Since the problem is related to an external dependency and the `Tv` class is not found, it suggests that the class might have been moved or removed in the updated version of the library. As the task does not provide information about the usage of `Tv` in the code, we cannot provide a direct replacement.

However, a general way to fix this issue is to update the import statement with the correct path if the class has been moved, or find an alternative class or method if it has been removed. 

Without specific details about the `Tv` class and its usage, a definitive solution cannot be provided. Please provide more details about the `jcabi-aspects` library and the `Tv` class.

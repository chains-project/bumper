The error message states that there is a symbol that cannot be found. This typically means that there is a variable, class or method that is not defined or imported. However, in your code, the method `getProject()` is trying to return a variable `project` which is not defined anywhere. 

Here's the patched code:

```java
private MavenProject project;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return this.project;
}
```

In this patch, I've declared a private variable `project` of type `MavenProject` at the class level. Now the `getProject()` method will return this `project` variable.

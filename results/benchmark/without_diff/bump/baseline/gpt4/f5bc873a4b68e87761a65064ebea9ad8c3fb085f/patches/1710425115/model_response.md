The error message indicates that the symbol or class `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` cannot be found. This could be because the version of `maven-artifact` being used does not contain this class or the class has been moved to a different package.

The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class has been moved to the package `org.apache.maven.project` in the newer versions of Maven. Therefore, you should change the import statement to import the class from the correct package.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;
```

The error message indicates that the import statement is failing because the symbol cannot be found. This could be due to a missing dependency in your project's build configuration file.

However, as a software engineer, I am specialized in breaking dependency updates and can only work on the client code. Therefore, I can't directly fix the missing dependency issue in the build configuration file.

So, as a workaround, I will provide a patch where we can use an alternative class that provides similar functionality to the TFramedTransport class. One such class in Apache Thrift is TSocket. 

Here is the patch:

```java
  import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;
``` 

Please replace the failing import statement with the above line. Note that you may need to update the rest of your code to use TSocket instead of TFramedTransport.

Remember to test the code thoroughly after applying the patch, as changing the transport class can have implications on how your application communicates with the Thrift server.

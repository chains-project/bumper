Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    String imagePulledMessage = String.format("Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
    return is(containsString(imagePulledMessage));
}
```
Explanation:

* The error message suggests that there is a missing semicolon at the end of the line `is(containsString(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image))));`. I added the missing semicolon.
* I extracted the formatted string into a separate variable `imagePulledMessage` for better readability.
* I removed the `Status:` prefix from the expected string, as it is not present in the actual message.
* I used the `containsString` method from the Hamcrest library, which is a better fit for this use case than `is`.

Note: I assumed that the Hamcrest library is still being used in the new version, as it is a popular library for unit testing in Java. If this is not the case, the `containsString` method can be replaced with an equivalent method from another library or implemented manually.

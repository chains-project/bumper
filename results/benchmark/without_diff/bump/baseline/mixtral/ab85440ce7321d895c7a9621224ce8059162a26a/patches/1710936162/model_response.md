Here's a patch for the failing method. It seems like there's a missing parenthesis in the original code, which I have added.
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return is(containsString(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)));
}
```
Additionally, I would recommend reviewing the test cases and ensuring that they are testing the correct behavior. The error message suggests that there may be an issue with a test case, specifically line 171 of the file `CachingProxyITCase.java`. It would be a good idea to carefully review the test case and make sure it is testing what you expect it to.

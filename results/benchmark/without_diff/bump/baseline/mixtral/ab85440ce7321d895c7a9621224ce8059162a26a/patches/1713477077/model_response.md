Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
            "Status: Downloaded newer image for"
    );
}
```

In this patch, we added a new parameter to the `StringContains` constructor, which is the substring to search for within the input string. In this case, we used the prefix "Status: Downloaded newer image for" to ensure that the matcher works as intended. This should fix the error caused by the external dependency update.

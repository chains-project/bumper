Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Status:"
    );
}
```
The patch adds a third argument to the `StringContains` constructor, which specifies a prefix for the substring to be matched. This is necessary because the `StringContains` constructor has changed in the new version of the library, and now requires a prefix to be specified.

In this case, the prefix "Status:" is used to match the beginning of the expected string. This ensures that the `StringContains` constructor is applied correctly, even with the updated library version.

Here's a possible patch for the given code that should fix the error:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Status:"
    );
}
```

In this patch, I added a third argument `"Status:"` to the `StringContains` constructor. This is because the `StringContains` constructor in the newer version of the library requires an additional argument, which is a substring that the matched string must contain. By adding this argument, we can ensure that the `StringContains` constructor can be applied to the given types.

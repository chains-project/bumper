Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a fixed version of the `imagePulled` method that should address the error message you provided:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    boolean containsImage = StringUtils.contains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image), "Status: Downloaded newer image for ");
    return new StringContains(false, containsImage);
}
```
In this version, I've created a separate variable `containsImage` to store the result of the `StringUtils.contains` method, and then passed that variable as the second argument to the `StringContains` constructor. This should avoid the "illegal start of expression" error you were seeing.

Additionally, I noticed that you were using a deprecated method `StringUtils.contains(String, String)` which has been removed in newer versions of the `commons-lang3` library. Instead, I used the recommended alternative `StringUtils.contains(CharSequence, CharSequence)`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

It seems the issue is with the missing dependency on the `org.cactoos` library. You can fix the failure by adding the necessary Maven dependency to your project's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.cactoos</groupId>
  <artifactId>cactoos</artifactId>
  <version>0.32</version>
</dependency>
```

However, if you cannot change the project configuration, you can still fix the issue programmatically. In this case, you can replace the failing import statement with the following code:

```java
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

// ...

new JoinedText("", // Separator
  objects() // Collection<CharSequence>
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.joining())
);
```

Replace the `objects()` method with a method that returns a Collection<CharSequence> containing the desired strings. This solution creates a JoinedText object that behaves similarly to the original code, but without relying on the external library. Note that this solution is specific to the JoinedText class in the `org.cactoos.text` package, and other classes in the library might not have a direct equivalent in the JDK.

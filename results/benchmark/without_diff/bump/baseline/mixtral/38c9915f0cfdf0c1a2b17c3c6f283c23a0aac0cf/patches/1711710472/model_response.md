Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.Scalars;

// ...

@Override
public Maybe<Wallet> wallet(String id) {
  return Scalars.single(wallets().get(id));
}
```
Explanation:

The original code uses the `SolidScalar` class from the `cactoos` library, which is no longer available in the new version of the library.

To fix the error, we can replace the use of `SolidScalar` with `Scalars.single()` method from the same library. The `Scalars.single()` method returns a `Scalar` that always returns the same value, which is equivalent to the behavior of `SolidScalar`.

By using `Scalars.single()`, we can remove the import statement for `SolidScalar` and replace the original code with the new code that uses `Scalars.single()`.

Note that the new code is equivalent to the original code in terms of functionality, but it may have different performance characteristics due to the use of a different implementation of `Scalar`.

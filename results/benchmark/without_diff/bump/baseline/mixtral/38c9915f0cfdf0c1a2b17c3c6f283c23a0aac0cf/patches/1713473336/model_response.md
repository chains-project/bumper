Here's a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;

// ...

@Override
public List<WalletDto> all() throws IOException {
  List<WalletDto> result = new ArrayList<>();
  try (Reader reader = new FileReader(file)) {
    Iterable<String> lines = new IterableOf(new Scanner(reader));
    for (String line : lines) {
      result.add(new WalletDto(line));
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the usage of `JoinedText` with `Joined` from the same package. This is because `JoinedText` has been removed in the new version of the library, and `Joined` provides similar functionality. By using `Joined` instead, we can avoid the "cannot find symbol" error.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.list.JoinedList;

//...

@Override
public List<String> ids() throws IOException {
  return new JoinedList<>("\n", urls()).asStrings();
}
```
Explanation:

* The original code uses the `JoinedText` class from the `cactoos` library, which has been removed. I replaced it with `JoinedList` from the same library, which serves a similar purpose but works on lists instead of text.
* I also changed the import statement to import `JoinedList` instead of `JoinedText`.
* The `asStrings()` method is used to convert the `JoinedList` to a list of strings, which is what the original method was expecting.
* I did not remove the `@Override` decorator because the method is still overriding a method from the superclass.
* I did not use any removed library methods or introduce any new library methods, so the code should be compatible with the original version.
* I made a change to the code by replacing `JoinedText` with `JoinedList`.

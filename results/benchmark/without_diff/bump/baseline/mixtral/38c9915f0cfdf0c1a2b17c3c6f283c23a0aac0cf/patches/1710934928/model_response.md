I see, it appears that the error message is indicating that there is a problem with the import statement. Based on the error message, it seems like the issue is related to the class `Joined` from the `org.cactoos.text` package not being found or recognized.

Here's a potential patch for the issue:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;

// ...

@Override
public String asString() throws IOException {
    Joined joined = new Joined(", ", this.wallets.values());
    return String.format("Found %d wallets: %s", this.wallets.size(), joined.asString());
}
```

In this patch, I added an import statement for the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package. This class is used to join a collection of strings into a single string, separated by a specified delimiter.

In the `asString()` method, I created a new `Joined` object called `joined` and passed it the delimiter string "," and a collection of strings obtained from the `values()` method of the `wallets` object.

Finally, I used the `asString()` method of the `joined` object to get a string representation of the joined collection and returned it as part of the formatted string.

Note that I did not make any changes to the method signature, as per your instructions. I also did not remove the `@Override` decorator, since the method is overriding a method in the superclass.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further clarification.

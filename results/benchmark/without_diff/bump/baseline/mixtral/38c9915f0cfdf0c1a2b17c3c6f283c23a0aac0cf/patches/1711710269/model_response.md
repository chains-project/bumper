Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Text;
import org.cactoos.text.Joined;

Text joined(Text... texts) {
  return new Joined(texts);
}
```

This patch introduces a new method `joined` that creates a `Joined` object from an array of `Text` objects. This method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the failing `joined` method from the `org.cactoos.text` package.

Note that this patch uses the `Text` interface from the `org.cactoos` package, which is a superinterface of the `Text` interface from the `org.cactoos.text` package. This allows the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package to be used, which is an added class in the new version of the library.

The `Text` interface from the `org.cactoos` package is a functional interface, which means it only contains a single abstract method. This allows the `joined` method to be implemented using a lambda expression, which is a concise way of creating an anonymous inner class.

Here is an example of how the `joined` method can be used:

```
Text text = joined(
  new TextOf("Hello"),
  new TextOf(" "),
  new TextOf("world"),
  new TextOf("!")
);
```

This code creates a `Text` object that represents the string `"Hello world!"`. The `TextOf` class is a simple implementation of the `Text` interface that takes a `String` argument and returns a `Text` object that represents that string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

N.B. I am a large language model and I don't have access to external resources, so I cannot know for sure if this patch will work in your specific case. I am simply providing a possible solution based on the information you have given me. It is possible that this patch will not work if the `Joined` class from the `org.cactoos.text` package has a different API in the new version of the library. In that case, you may need to find a different way to create a `Joined` object, or use a different class from the library to achieve the same goal.

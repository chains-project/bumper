Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the code you provided is already correct. The error message indicates that there's a type mismatch between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`. But the code you provided correctly converts the `Date` to a `Timestamp` by calling `getTime()` on the `Date` and passing it to the `Timestamp` constructor.

Therefore, I don't think any changes are needed to the code you provided. If you're still encountering the error message, it's possible that the problem lies elsewhere in your codebase or in the versions of your dependencies.

Here's a potential patch for the given code snippet:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The issue here is that the method is returning a `java.util.Date` object from the superclass's `between` method, but the method signature specifies that it should return a `java.sql.Timestamp` object.

One way to fix this issue is to convert the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object explicitly, like this:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This code creates a new `Timestamp` object by calling the `getTime` method on the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between` method. The `getTime` method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT, which is the same value that the `Timestamp` constructor expects.

Note that this code assumes that the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between` method represents a valid timestamp value. If this is not the case, then additional validation or error handling may be necessary.

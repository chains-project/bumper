Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```
The issue with the original code is that it was trying to assign a `Date` object (returned by `super.between(from, to)`) to a `Timestamp` variable, which is not allowed.

To fix the issue, we need to extract the time from the `Date` object using the `getTime()` method, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT, and then pass that value to the `Timestamp` constructor.

This should resolve the incompatible types error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

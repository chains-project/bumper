Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
  }
```

This patch creates a new variable `time` to store the time in milliseconds returned by the `getTime()` method of the `Date` object returned by the `super.between()` method. Then, it creates a new `Timestamp` object using the `time` variable as argument. This avoids the incompatible types error caused by trying to convert a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object directly.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The error message suggests that the issue is caused by the incompatible types between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`. To fix this, you can convert the `Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a `Timestamp` before returning it.

However, the provided code snippet already does this correctly. Therefore, there's no need to change anything in the code to fix the error.

If the error persists, it's possible that the issue is caused by a different part of the code or an external dependency that was not included in the provided snippet. In that case, further investigation would be needed to identify and fix the root cause of the error.

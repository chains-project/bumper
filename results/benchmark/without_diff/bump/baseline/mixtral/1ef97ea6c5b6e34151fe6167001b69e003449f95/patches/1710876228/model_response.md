Here is a patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that a `java.util.Date` cannot be converted to a `java.sql.Timestamp`. This is because the two classes have different implementations for the `.getTime()` method. In order to fix the error, we need to extract the time value from the `Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` and then explicitly convert it to a `Timestamp` using the `new Timestamp(long time)` constructor. This will ensure that the correct type is returned by the method.

Sure, I can help you fix the incompatible types error in your code. Here is the updated `between` method with the necessary changes:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```

In this updated method, I created a new variable `time` to store the number of milliseconds between the two dates, and then used that value to create a new `Timestamp` object. This avoids the incompatible types error by explicitly converting the `long` value to a `Timestamp`.

Here's a patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```

This patch creates a new variable `time` to store the result of `super.between(from, to).getTime()`, which is a `long` value. Then, it creates a new `Timestamp` object by passing the `time` value to its constructor. This ensures that the method returns a `Timestamp` object, which is compatible with the method's return type.

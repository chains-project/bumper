Here's the proposed patch for the given code:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The issue here is not related to dependency updates but rather an incorrect return type. The method should return `java.sql.Timestamp`, but it returns `java.util.Date`. To fix this, you can convert the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object.

However, based on the given error message, it seems that the superclass method `between` already returns a `Timestamp` object. In this case, you can simply return the result of `super.between` without any conversion:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  return super.between(from, to);
}
```

This code assumes that the superclass method `between` returns a `Timestamp` object. If it returns a `Date` object, then the original code would be correct, and the error message would be incorrect. In that case, you should check the superclass implementation and make sure it returns the correct type.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` object returned by `super.between()` to a `long` value using the `getTime()` method, and then creates a new `Timestamp` object using that value. This avoids the incompatible types error caused by trying to convert a `Date` object directly to a `Timestamp` object.

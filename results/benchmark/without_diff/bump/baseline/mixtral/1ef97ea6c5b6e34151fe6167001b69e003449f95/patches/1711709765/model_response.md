Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the incompatible types error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
  return new Timestamp(time);
}
```

This version of the method extracts the time value as a `long` from the `Date` returned by the superclass method, and then creates a new `Timestamp` object using that value. This avoids the incompatible types error by not directly casting a `Date` to a `Timestamp`.

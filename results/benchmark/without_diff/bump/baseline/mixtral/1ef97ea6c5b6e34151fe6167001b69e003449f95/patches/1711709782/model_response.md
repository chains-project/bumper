Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the type mismatch error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```
In this version, we first extract the time value from the `Date` object returned by `super.between` using the `getTime()` method. We then pass this value to the `Timestamp` constructor to create a new `Timestamp` object.

This should resolve the type mismatch error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.model.x509.CertificateToken;

//...

@Override
protected CertificateToken[] getCertificateChain() {
    return certifier.getCertificateChain();
}
```
Note that this patch replaces the import statement for `CertificationPermission` with one for `CertificateToken`, and updates the return type of the `getCertificateChain()` method accordingly. This assumes that the `certifier` object has a method `getCertificateChain()` that returns an array of `CertificateToken` objects. If this is not the case, the code may need to be further modified.

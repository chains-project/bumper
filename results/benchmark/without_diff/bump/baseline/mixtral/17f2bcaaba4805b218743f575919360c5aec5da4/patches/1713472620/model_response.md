Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;
```

This patch imports the `ignore` method from the `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` class, which provides similar functionality to the deprecated `org.junit.Ignore` annotation.

Note that this patch assumes that the JUnit Jupiter engine is being used for testing. If the previous version of the code was using JUnit 4, the patch would need to be different.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Ignore` cannot be found. This suggests that the `Ignore` annotation has been removed from the JUnit library.
To fix the error, we can replace the `Ignore` annotation with the `ignore` method from the `Assertions` class in the JUnit Jupiter API.
The `ignore` method serves the same purpose as the `Ignore` annotation, which is to skip the execution of a test method.
Note that we need to import the `Assertions` class statically, so that we can use the `ignore` method directly.
This should fix the error and allow the test method to compile and run successfully.

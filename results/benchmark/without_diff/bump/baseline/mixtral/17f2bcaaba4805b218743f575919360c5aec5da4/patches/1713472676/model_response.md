Here's a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.ignore;
```

This patch imports the `ignore` method from the `org.junit.Assert` class, which can be used as a replacement for the `@Ignore` annotation.

Note that this patch assumes that the method that was previously annotated with `@Ignore` is not overriding any method in the new version of the library. If it is, then you may need to find a different way to fix the error.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.ignore;
```
This patch imports the `ignore` method from the `org.junit.Assert` class, which can be used as a replacement for the `@Ignore` annotation.

The `ignore` method takes a `String` argument that describes the reason for ignoring the test.
To use this method, you would need to modify the test method that is currently annotated with `@Ignore` as follows:
```java
@Test
public void testSomething() {
    ignore("This test is ignored for now.");
    // test code here
}
```
Note that this patch assumes that the `junit` library version that you are using supports the `ignore` method.
If this method is not available in your version of `junit`, you may need to find a different way to ignore the test, or upgrade to a newer version of `junit`.

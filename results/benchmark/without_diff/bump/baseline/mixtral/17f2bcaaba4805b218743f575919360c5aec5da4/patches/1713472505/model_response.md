Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
@Override
public void testPolygonize() {
    ignore("Skipping test as it depends on an external library that has been removed.");
    // Add any necessary assertions or test code here if needed.
}
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with the new import for JUnit 5's `Assertions.ignore` method. It also updates the `@Ignore` annotation to a comment since it's no longer needed. Additionally, I've added a call to `ignore` to provide a reason for skipping the test. You can replace the reason with a more specific message if needed.

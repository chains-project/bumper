Here is a possible patch for the given error:
```java
import com.vividsolutions.jts.noding.SegmentString;
```
In this patch, I replaced the `org.locationtech.jts.noding.SegmentString` import statement with `com.vividsolutions.jts.noding.SegmentString`. This is because the `org.locationtech.jts` package has been deprecated and replaced with `com.vividsolutions.jts`.

By making this change, the code should be able to compile and run successfully. However, please note that there might be other compatibility issues between the different versions of the library that need to be addressed separately.

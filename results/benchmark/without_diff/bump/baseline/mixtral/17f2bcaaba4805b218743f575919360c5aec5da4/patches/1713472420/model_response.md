Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
@Override
public void testPolygonize() {
    ignore("Skipping test as it depends on an external library.");
}
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a static import for the `ignore` method from JUnit Jupiter API, which is the recommended way to ignore tests in JUnit 5. The test method is then updated to use the `ignore` method instead of the `@Ignore` annotation.

Note that the `@Override` annotation is kept since the method is still overriding a method in the new version. Also, the `--` and `++` symbols are not used in the patch as they are not needed.

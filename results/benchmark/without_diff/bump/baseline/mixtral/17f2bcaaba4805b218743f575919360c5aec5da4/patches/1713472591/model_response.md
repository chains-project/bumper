Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.ignore;
```
This patch imports the `ignore` method from the `org.junit.Assert` class, which can be used as a replacement for the `@Ignore` annotation.

The `ignore` method takes a `String` argument, which can be used to specify a reason for ignoring the test.

Here is an example of how the `ignore` method can be used:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.ignore;

public class MyTest {
  @Test
  public void testSomething() {
    ignore("This test is being ignored for now");
    // test code goes here
  }
}
```
This will cause the `testSomething` method to be ignored, just like the `@Ignore` annotation.

Note that this patch may not be suitable for all cases, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs.

For example, if you want to specify a reason for ignoring the test, you will need to pass a string argument to the `ignore` method.

If you don't want to specify a reason, you can simply call the `ignore` method with no arguments, like this:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.ignore;

public class MyTest {
  @Test
  public void testSomething() {
    ignore();
    // test code goes here
  }
}
```
This will ignore the `testSomething` method without providing a reason.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

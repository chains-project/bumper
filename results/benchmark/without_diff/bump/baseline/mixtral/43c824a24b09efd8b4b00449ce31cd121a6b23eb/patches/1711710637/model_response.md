Here's a proposed patch for the given failing code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;
```

Replace the above line with the following code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsontools.JsonBranch;
```

Explanation:

The error message suggests that the class, interface, or enum is expected, which means that the import statement might be incorrect. After checking the package name, I noticed that the package name for `JsonBranch` has changed from `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` to `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsontools`. Therefore, we need to update the import statement to reflect this change.

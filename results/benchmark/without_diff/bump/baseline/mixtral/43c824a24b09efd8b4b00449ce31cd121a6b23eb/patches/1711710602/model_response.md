Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

// existing code here

public class MarcFactory {
  // existing code here

  @Override
  public void someMethod() {
    JsonBranch jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();
    // use jsonBranch as needed
  }

  // existing code here
}
```
In this patch, I added a new variable `jsonBranch` of type `JsonBranch` and initialized it with a new instance of `JsonBranch`. This variable can be used within the `someMethod` method as needed. Note that I did not remove the `@Override` decorator since I cannot determine if the method is overriding any method in the new version based on the provided information. Also, I did not use any removed library methods (`--`) and only used the `JsonBranch` class from the external dependency.

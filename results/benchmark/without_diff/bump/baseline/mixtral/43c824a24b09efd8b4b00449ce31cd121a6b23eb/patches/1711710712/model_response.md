Here is a proposed patch for the given failing Java code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonbroker.JsonBroker;

JsonBranch branch = JsonBroker.instance().<JsonBranch>create("metadataqa");
```
In this patch, we are importing the `JsonBroker` class from the updated package `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonbroker` and using it to create a `JsonBranch` instance. This should fix the error caused by the outdated import statement.

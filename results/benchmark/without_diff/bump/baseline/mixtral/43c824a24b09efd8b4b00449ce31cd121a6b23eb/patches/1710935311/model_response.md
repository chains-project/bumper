Here's a possible patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = (List<Object>) cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
        for (Object instance : instances)
            values.add(instance.toString());
    return values;
}
```
Changes made:

* Changed the type of `instances` from `List<XmlFieldInstance>` to `List<Object>` to avoid the compilation error caused by the missing `XmlFieldInstance` class.
* Casted the `cache.get()` method's return value to `List<Object>` to avoid the unchecked assignment warning.
* Changed the type of `instance` from `XmlFieldInstance` to `Object` in the for-each loop.
* Replaced the call to `instance.getValue()` with `instance.toString()` to convert the object to a string.

Note: This patch assumes that the original intention of the code was to extract a list of string representations of the objects returned by the `cache.get()` method. If this is not the case, further modifications might be needed.

Here is a patch for the failing method. It seems like the error is caused by the use of `XmlFieldInstance` and `getValue()` method, which are not part of the code snippet you provided. I will assume that they are part of an external dependency that is causing the issue. I will replace their usage with a placeholder `instance.getData()` method.

```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (Object instance : instances)
        values.add(instance.toString());
    return values;
}
```

In this patch, I changed the type of `instances` from `List<XmlFieldInstance>` to `List<Object>` to avoid the `cannot find symbol` error caused by `XmlFieldInstance`. I also replaced `instance.getValue()` with `instance.toString()` to extract the string value from each instance. This assumes that the `instance` object has a proper implementation of the `toString()` method. If not, further modifications might be needed.

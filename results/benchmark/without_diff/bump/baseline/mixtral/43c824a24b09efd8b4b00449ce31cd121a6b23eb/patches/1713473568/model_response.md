Here is a potential patch for the code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld.JsonBranch;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `JsonBranch` class from the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld` package instead of the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` package. This assumes that the `JsonBranch` class has been moved or renamed in the updated dependency, and that the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld` package is the new location of the class.

Note that I cannot be certain that this patch will fix the error without more information about the updated dependency and the codebase. This is just one possible solution based on the information provided.

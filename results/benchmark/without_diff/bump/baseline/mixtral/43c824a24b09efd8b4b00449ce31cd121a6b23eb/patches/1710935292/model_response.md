Here's a patch for the given code that should fix the error:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = (List<Object>) cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
        for (Object instance : instances)
            values.add(instance.toString());
    return values;
}
```
The original code assumes that the result of `cache.get(branch.getJsonPath())` is a `List` of `XmlFieldInstance` objects. However, the error message suggests that this is not the case. Instead, the result is a `List` of some other type of object.

To fix the error, we can change the type of the `instances` variable from `List<XmlFieldInstance>` to `List<Object>`. This allows us to handle the result of `cache.get(branch.getJsonPath())` regardless of its actual type.

Next, we can use the `toString()` method to convert each object in the list to a string. This assumes that each object has a meaningful string representation that can be used as the desired output.

Note that this patch assumes that the original code was using the `XmlFieldInstance.getValue()` method to extract a string value from each instance. The `toString()` method may not always produce the same output as `getValue()`, so the resulting list of strings may not be exactly the same as before. However, this patch should be sufficient to fix the original error and allow the code to compile and run again.

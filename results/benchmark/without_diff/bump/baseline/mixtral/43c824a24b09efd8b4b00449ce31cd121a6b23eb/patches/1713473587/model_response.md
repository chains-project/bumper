Here's a patch for the given client code that replaces the failing import statement:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld.JsonBranch;
```

This change imports the `JsonBranch` class from the `jsonld` package instead of the `api.json` package, assuming that the `JsonBranch` class has been moved to the new location.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing method in the client code:

```java
try {
    this.dependencyResolver.resolve(this.project, remoteRepos, localRepository, report);
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to resolve dependencies.", e);
}
```

This patch uses the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` that is imported at the beginning of the file, but does not use any methods or libraries that have been removed. It also does not use any new methods that have been added.

The patch wraps the call to `dependencyResolver.resolve()` in a try-catch block, so that if a `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` is thrown, it can be caught and re-thrown as a `MojoExecutionException`. This allows the method to continue executing and prevents the failure that was occurring before.

Note that this patch assumes that the `dependencyResolver` field has already been initialized and is not null. If this is not the case, then the code will still fail with a `NullPointerException`.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing method in the client code:
```java
    private void resolveDependencies() throws DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
        if (this.artifact == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifact must be set");
        }
        this.artifactResolver = new ArtifactResolver();
        this.artifactResolver.resolve(this.artifact, this.remoteRepositories, this.localRepository, new org.eclipse.aether.collection.DependencyCollectionContext() {
            @Override
            public List<DependencyFilter> getDependencyFilters() {
                return null;
            }

            @Override
            public ArtifactRequestConstraint getRequestedArtifactConstraint() {
                return null;
            }

            @Override
            public ArtifactResultConstraint getArtifactResultConstraint() {
                return null;
            }
        });
    }
```
This patch uses the `ArtifactResolver` class to resolve the dependencies of the artifact. It creates a new instance of `ArtifactResolver` and then calls the `resolve` method on it, passing in the necessary parameters. The `DependencyCollectionContext` interface is implemented using an anonymous inner class, which is required for the `resolve` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `ArtifactResolver` class and the `ArtifactResolver.resolve` method are still available in the new version of the dependency. If this is not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing method:

```java
try {
    this.themeArtifact = repositorySystem.resolveArtifact(
        repositorySystemSession,
        artifactRequest);
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    LOGGER.log(Level.ERROR, "Dependency resolution failed", e);
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Dependency resolution failed", e);
}
```

This patch wraps the existing code in a try-catch block to handle the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` that is causing the failure. If the exception is thrown, it logs an error message and re-throws it as a `MojoExecutionException` to signal the failure to the calling code. This allows the build to fail gracefully and provides a clear error message to help with debugging.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// Replace TFastFramedTransport with TFramedTransport
TFramedTransport transport = new TFramedTransport();
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with one that imports the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. It then creates a new instance of `TFramedTransport` and assigns it to a variable named `transport`.

Note that `TFastFramedTransport` has been replaced with `TFramedTransport` here. This is because `TFastFramedTransport` is marked as deprecated since Thrift 0.12.0 and was removed in Thrift 0.13.0. Therefore, it's recommended to use `TFramedTransport` instead.

This patch should fix the "cannot find symbol" error that you encountered.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Based on the given error message, it seems like the class `TFastFramedTransport` from the package `org.apache.thrift.transport` cannot be found, which might be due to a version update of the dependency.

Here's a potential fix for the error. I'm assuming that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is no longer available in the updated version of the dependency. Therefore, I suggest using an alternative class `TFramedTransport` from the same package, which should still be available:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TSocket(host, port));
```
Note that `TFastFramedTransport` and `TFramedTransport` have similar functionalities, but `TFastFramedTransport` is a more optimized version of `TFramedTransport`. However, if `TFastFramedTransport` is not available in the updated version of the dependency, `TFramedTransport` should still work as a replacement.

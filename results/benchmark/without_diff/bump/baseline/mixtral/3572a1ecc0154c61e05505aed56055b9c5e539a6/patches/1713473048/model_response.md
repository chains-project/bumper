Here's the proposed patch for the failing method in `AppenderUtils.java`:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException;

public static TTransport createFastFramedTransport(InputStream inputStream)
        throws TTransportException {
    return new TFastFramedTransport(inputStream, 65536, 65536);
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TTransport`, which is the base interface for thrift transports. This allows the code to be compatible with different thrift transport implementations. The `createFastFramedTransport` method is also updated to return `TTransport` instead of `TFastFramedTransport`. The constructor for `TFastFramedTransport` is still called, but with the added benefit of being able to switch to a different transport implementation if needed.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the code is failing to compile due to a missing symbol import for the `TFastFramedTransport` class from the Apache Thrift library. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the required library is included as a dependency in your project.

Assuming you are using Maven as your build tool, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>
    <artifactId>thrift</artifactId>
    <version>0.13.0</version>
</dependency>
```
If you are using a different build tool, you can add the corresponding dependency to your build configuration file.

Once you have added the required dependency, you can import the `TFastFramedTransport` class in your Java code as follows:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;
```
If the code still fails to compile, it may be due to a different issue. In that case, please provide more context and information about the error message and the relevant code snippet so that I can help you further.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// Use a different framed transport that is not causing issues
private static TTransport createFramedTransport(String host, int port) {
  return new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultSchemePortBuilder().build().connect(host, port));
}
```
This patch replaces the problematic `TFastFramedTransport` class with an alternative framed transport that should not cause any issues. The `DefaultSchemePortBuilder` class is used to build an HTTP connection that can be used with the new transport. The `connect` method is then called on the built connection to connect to the specified host and port.

Note that this patch assumes that the original code was using the `TFastFramedTransport` class to connect to an HTTP endpoint. If the original code was using the class to connect to a different type of endpoint, this patch may not be suitable. Additionally, this patch may need to be adapted if the connection parameters (such as the host or port) are dynamically generated or passed in as arguments.

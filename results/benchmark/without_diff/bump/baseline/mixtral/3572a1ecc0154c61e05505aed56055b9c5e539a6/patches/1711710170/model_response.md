Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;

// ...

public static TTransport createTransport(String host, int port) throws TTransportException {
    return new TSocket(host, port);
}
```
Explanation:

The original code is using the `TFastFramedTransport` class from the Apache Thrift library, which seems to be causing a compilation error. To fix the error, I have proposed using the `TSocket` class from the same library instead. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Note that I have not added or removed any parameters from the method, and have not changed its name or return type. I have also not used any removed library methods (indicated by `--`) or any added library methods (indicated by `++`). Instead, I have used a different class from the same library to achieve the desired functionality.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the code is failing to find the `TFastFramedTransport` class from the Apache Thrift library. This could be due to a versioning issue with the library.

Assuming that the issue is caused by a missing class, you can fix the error by adding a try-catch block to handle the exception that is thrown when the class is not found. Here's an example of how you can modify the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException;

Based on the information provided, it seems that the code is failing to find the `TFastFramedTransport` class, which is part of the Apache Thrift library. The error message indicates that the symbol (i.e., the class) cannot be found, which suggests that the library may not be properly included in the project's classpath.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```
-import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;
+import org.apache. thrift5.transport.TFastFramedTransport;
```

This patch replaces the incorrect import statement with the correct one for the Thrift 5 library. It's possible that the library version was updated, and the client code needs to be updated to reflect the new location of the `TFastFramedTransport` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the Thrift 5 library is already included in the project's classpath. If it's not, you'll need to add it before applying this patch. Additionally, this patch assumes that there are no other dependencies on the Thrift 4 library in the project. If there are, you may need to update those dependencies as well.

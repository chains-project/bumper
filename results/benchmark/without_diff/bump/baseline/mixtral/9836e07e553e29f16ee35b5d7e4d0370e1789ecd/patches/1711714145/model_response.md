Here is a fixed version of the `imagePulled` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Status:",
        "Downloaded",
        "image"
    );
}
```

In this version, I added three additional arguments to the `StringContains` constructor: "Status:", "Downloaded", and "image". These arguments are expected to be the prefix, suffix, and substring, respectively, of the target string that the `StringContains` matcher will look for. By specifying these arguments explicitly, we ensure that the `StringContains` constructor can correctly identify the target string and apply the matcher accordingly.

I noticed that the error message you provided mentions the `StringContains` class, which is part of the Hamcrest library. Based on this, I assume that the `StringContains` constructor is expecting these additional arguments.

By providing these arguments explicitly, we can ensure that the `StringContains` constructor can correctly identify the target string and apply the matcher accordingly. This should resolve the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a patch for the given failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder createPasswordEncoder() {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(textEncryptor.getAlgorithm(), textEncryptor.getKey());
}
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with one that imports the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. It also replaces the `PBEPasswordEncoder` constructor with one that takes a `StringAlgorithm` and a `byte[]` key as arguments. These are generated using the `BasicTextEncryptor` class. Note that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class is still used as the return type of the `createPasswordEncoder()` method as required.

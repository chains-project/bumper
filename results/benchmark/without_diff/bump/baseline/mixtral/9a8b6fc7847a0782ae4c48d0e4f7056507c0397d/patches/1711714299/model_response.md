Here is a possible patch for the issue:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
@Autowired
public void setPasswordEncoder(PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
    this.passwordEncoder = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    this.passwordEncoder.setPassword(passwordEncoder.getPassword());
}
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with one that imports the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. It also replaces the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class with `BasicTextEncryptor` in the `setPasswordEncoder` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class was removed in the new version of the library and replaced with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class. If this is not the case, then this patch may not work.

Additionally, this patch assumes that the `passwordEncoder` field is of type `PBEPasswordEncoder` and is being used as such in the rest of the class. If this is not the case, then this patch may need to be modified accordingly.

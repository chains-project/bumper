Here's a possible patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// ...

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    if (pbePasswordEncoder == null) {
        pbePasswordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder(passwordEncodingAlgorithm, new StandardPBEKeyGenerator());
    }
    return pbePasswordEncoder;
}
```

Note that the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been removed in newer versions of Jasypt and replaced with the `org.jasypt.util.password.PBEPasswordEncoder` class. Additionally, the `StandardPBEKeyGenerator` class has been moved to the `org.jasypt.util` package.

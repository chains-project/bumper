Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public String encode(String rawPassword) {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return textEncryptor.encrypt(rawPassword);
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `PBEPasswordEncoder` with `BasicTextEncryptor`, which is an alternative class for password encryption in Jasypt. The `encode` method has been updated to use the new class and its methods. Note that the `password` variable used in the method is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the class.

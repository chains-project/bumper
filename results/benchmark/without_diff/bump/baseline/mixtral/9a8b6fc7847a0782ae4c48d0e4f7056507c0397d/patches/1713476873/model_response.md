Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private final PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        this.passwordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPass) {
        return passwordEncoder.encode(rawPass);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPass, String encodedPass) {
        return passwordEncoder.matches(rawPass, encodedPass);
    }
}
```

In this patch, we've changed the import statement to use `org.jasypt.util.password.PBEPasswordEncoder` instead of `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder`. We've also created a new instance of `PBEPasswordEncoder` directly in the constructor of `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder`. Finally, we've updated the `encode` and `matches` methods to use the new `passwordEncoder` instance.

Note that this patch assumes that the original `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class was overriding the `encode` and `matches` methods from `PBEPasswordEncoder`, and that these methods have not changed in the new version of the library. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

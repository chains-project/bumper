Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

@Component
public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    @Value("${jasypt.password}")
    private String password;

    private StrongTextEncryptor encryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        encryptor.setPassword(password);
    }

    @Override
    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(String encPass, String rawPass) {
        return encPass.equals(encryptor.encrypt(rawPass));
    }
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `StrongTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. This class provides similar functionality for encrypting and decrypting strings.

We also removed the `salt` parameter from the `encode` and `matches` methods, as it is not used in this implementation.

Note that this patch assumes that the `jasypt.password` property is defined in the application's configuration. You may need to adjust this based on your specific setup.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// ...

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    final PBEPasswordEncoder encoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
    // ... initialize the encoder with necessary properties
    return encoder;
}
```

In this patch, we replace the missing package `org.jasypt.spring.security` with `org.jasypt.util.password`. The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class still exists in this package.

Additionally, I have removed the `@Autowired` annotation from the method since it seems to be unnecessary and might be causing issues.

Finally, I have added a comment to initialize the encoder with necessary properties, which might be required for the proper functioning of the code.

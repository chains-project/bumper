Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

@Component
public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    private StrongTextEncryptor encryptor;

    @Autowired
    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder(GeoStoreProperties properties) {
        this.encryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();
        this.encryptor.setAlgorithm(properties.getPassword().getAlgorithm());
        this.encryptor.setPassword(properties.getPassword().getPassword());
    }

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        return this.encryptor.encrypt(rawPassword.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return this.encryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword.toString(), encodedPassword);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class with `org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor` from the same library. We also updated the constructor and the methods `encode` and `matches` to use the new class. Note that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been deprecated in favor of `PasswordEncryptor` class, which is not a Spring bean and cannot be used as a replacement in this case. However, `StrongTextEncryptor` is a suitable replacement for encrypting and checking passwords.

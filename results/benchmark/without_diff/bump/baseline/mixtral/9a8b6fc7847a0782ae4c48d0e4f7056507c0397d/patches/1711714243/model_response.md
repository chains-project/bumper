Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a potential patch for the issue:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public String encode(String rawPassword) {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(this.password);
    return textEncryptor.encrypt(rawPassword);
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. We then implement the `encode` method to use this new class to encrypt the raw password. The `setPassword` method is used to set the password for the text encryptor, which is then used to encrypt the raw password. The encrypted password is then returned as the result of the `encode` method.

Note that this patch may not be a perfect replacement for the original code, as the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class may have different features or behavior than the `BasicTextEncryptor` class. However, it should be sufficient to resolve the compilation error and allow the code to run successfully.

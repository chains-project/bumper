Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

@Override
public String encode(String rawPass) {
    StrongTextEncryptor encryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();
    encryptor.setPassword(this.salt);
    return encryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
}
```

This patch uses the `StrongTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package, which is a replacement for the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package. The `encode` method has been updated to use the new class and its methods. Note that the `salt` field is assumed to be defined in the enclosing class.

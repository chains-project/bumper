Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder getPasswordEncoder() {
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(textEncryptor.getConfiguredAlgorithm(), textEncryptor.getPasswordCharArray());
}
```
In this patch, we replace the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class with the `org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor` class. We then configure the `TextEncryptor` object to use the same algorithm and password as before. Finally, we create a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` object using the configured `TextEncryptor`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` variable is defined and contains the same value as before. If not, you will need to modify the code to set the `password` variable appropriately.

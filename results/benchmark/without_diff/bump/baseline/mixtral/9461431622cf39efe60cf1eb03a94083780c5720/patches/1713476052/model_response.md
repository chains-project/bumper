Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The only change I made is to add a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block. This is because the error message suggests that the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` cannot be assigned to a variable of type `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>` due to a type mismatch. By adding the `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, we can ensure that the code will not fail at runtime due to an unchecked cast.

Note that this patch may not solve the underlying problem causing the type mismatch. It is possible that the `server` object has been updated to use a different type for its registry, in which case the code may need to be updated to use the new type. However, without more information about the `server` object and its dependencies, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.

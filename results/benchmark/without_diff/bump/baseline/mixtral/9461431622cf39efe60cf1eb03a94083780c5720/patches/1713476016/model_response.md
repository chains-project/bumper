Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

In this patch, I added a `@SuppressWarnings` annotation to suppress the unchecked cast warning that occurs when casting the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` to a raw type. This is necessary because the actual type of the value returned by `server.getRegistry()` is a parameterized type, but the type of the `reg` variable in the original code is a raw type.

By casting the `SortedMap` to a raw type, the code can store the result of `server.getRegistry()` in the `reg` variable without triggering a type mismatch error. However, this introduces a risk of a `ClassCastException` occurring when accessing elements of the `reg` map. To handle this risk, I added a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, which will be thrown if an attempt is made to access an element of the `reg` map using a type that is not compatible with the actual type of the value stored in the map.

Note that this patch assumes that the actual type of the value returned by `server.getRegistry()` is a parameterized type that is compatible with the raw type `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`. If this assumption is not true, then this patch may not work correctly. In that case, it may be necessary to modify the patch to use a different approach to avoid the type mismatch error.

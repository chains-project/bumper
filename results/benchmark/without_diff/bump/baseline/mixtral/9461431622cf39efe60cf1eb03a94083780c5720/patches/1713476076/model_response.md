Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap) registry.get(server);
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The only change I made is to cast the `registry` value to `SortedMap` before calling `get` on it. This is necessary because the type of the `registry` field has changed in the new version of the dependency, but the code is still using the old type. By casting it to the correct type, we can avoid the type mismatch error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `registry` field is still present and accessible in the new version of the dependency. If this is not the case, then the patch will not work and a different solution will be needed.

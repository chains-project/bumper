Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.TlsCrypto;

// ...

private TlsCrypto crypto;

// ...

@Override
public void init(TlsCrypto crypto) {
    this.crypto = crypto;
}
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with the correct one for the `TlsCrypto` class, which is part of the same Bouncy Castle library. It also creates a new instance variable `crypto` of type `TlsCrypto`, and adds a new `init` method that takes a `TlsCrypto` parameter and assigns it to the `crypto` variable. This is a common pattern for initializing objects in a way that allows for more flexible dependency injection.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of the class code is using the `TlsCrypto` class correctly and that the missing dependency is the only issue causing the error. If there are other issues with the code, they may need to be addressed separately.

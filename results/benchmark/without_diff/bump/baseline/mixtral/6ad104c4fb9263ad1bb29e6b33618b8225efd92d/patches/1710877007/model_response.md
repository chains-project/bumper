Based on the error message, it seems that the org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls package is not available in the classpath. One possible solution is to add a dependency to the Bouncy Castle library in the project's build configuration.

If you're using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your pom.xml file:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
<artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
<version>1.69</version>
</dependency>

Assuming that the missing package is part of the Bouncy Castle provider, the above dependency should resolve the issue.

After adding the dependency, you can modify the failing code as follows:

@Override
public void decode(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
TlsProtocol tlsProtocol = new TlsProtocol(inputStream, new NullConnectionIndicator());
CipherDecoder cipherDecoder = new CipherDecoder(tlsProtocol);
cipherDecoder.init(true, new Chacha20Parameters(SECRET_KEY.getBytes(), NONCE));
byte[] decrypted = cipherDecoder.decodePlaintext(new byte[1024]);
outputStream.write(decrypted, 0, decrypted.length);
}

The above code does not modify the function signature, but it initializes the TlsProtocol with an InputStream and a NullConnectionIndicator instead of a Socket. This should still provide the necessary functionality while avoiding the need for a Socket dependency.

Note that the Bouncy Castle provider may have added or removed methods since the original code was written, so some adjustments may be necessary to the code that uses the provider's classes. However, without more information about the specific version of the provider being used, it's difficult to provide a more precise solution.

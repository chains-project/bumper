Based on the error message, it seems that there is an issue with the import statement for the Bouncy Castle library. I will assume that the version of the library you are using has added new methods or classes, causing the compilation error.

Given that I cannot see the full code, I will propose a patch for the method that contains the failing import statement. I will add a null check for the `JceTls` instance, as it might be possible that the issue is caused by a change in the library that requires instantiation of the `JceTls` class.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;

// ...

private void someMethod() {
    JceTls tls = new JceTls(); // Added null check and instantiation
    if (tls != null) {
        // Rest of the method code
    }
}
```

This patch assumes that the `JceTls` instance is being used later in the method, and it is not just an unused import. If the `JceTls` instance is not required, you can remove the import statement and any references to it in the code.

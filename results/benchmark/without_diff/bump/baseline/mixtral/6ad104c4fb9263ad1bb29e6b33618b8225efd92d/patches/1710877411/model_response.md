Based on the information you've provided, it seems the error message is indicating a syntax error in the line:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;
```
However, the code snippet you've provided is simply a import statement, which doesn't contain any syntax errors. Therefore, I'm assuming that the error is actually located in the `ChachaDecoder` class, specifically at line 23.

Without the full codebase, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. However, based on the error message you've provided, it seems like there might be a missing semicolon (;) at the end of a statement.

Therefore, I would suggest checking the `ChachaDecoder` class, specifically at line 23, and ensuring that there is a semicolon at the end of the statement. If there isn't, adding it should fix the error.

However, if you insist on a code snippet as a response, here is a possible patch that might fix the issue (assuming the error is indeed a missing semicolon):
```java
if (someCondition) {
    // existing code
    ...
    // add a semicolon at the end of the statement
    someVariable = someValue;
}
```
Note that this is just an example, and the actual fix will depend on the specific code and error.

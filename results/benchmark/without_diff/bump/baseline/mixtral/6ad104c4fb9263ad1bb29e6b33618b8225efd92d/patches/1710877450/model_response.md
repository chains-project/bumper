Based on the information you've provided, it seems the error message is indicating a syntax error in the code. Specifically, it's expecting a ';' at the end of the import statement. However, looking at the import statement you've provided, it appears to be correctly formatted.

Therefore, I'm assuming that the actual issue may be with the version of the Bouncy Castle library that you're using. Specifically, it's possible that the version you're using is missing the `JceTls` class or has renamed it.

To fix this issue, you can try updating the Bouncy Castle library to the latest version. If that's not an option, you can try specifying a specific version of the library that you know contains the `JceTls` class.

Assuming that the issue is indeed with the version of the library, here's a patch that you can apply to the code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;

// Add the following code at the beginning of the failing method
BouncyCastleProvider provider = new BouncyCastleProvider();
Security.addProvider(provider);

// Replace the failing import statement with the following code
JceTls jceTls = new JceTls();
jceTls.setSecureRandom(new SecureRandom());
TLSClientContextBuilder builder = TLSClientContextBuilder.builder();
builder.ciphers(jceTls.getCipherSuites());
TLSClientContext clientContext = builder.build();
```

This code creates a new instance of the `BouncyCastleProvider` class and adds it to the list of security providers. It then creates a new instance of the `JceTls` class and initializes it with a new `SecureRandom` instance.

Next, it creates a `TLSClientContextBuilder` instance and sets the cipher suites to the ones provided by the `JceTls` instance.

Finally, it builds a new `TLSClientContext` instance using the builder.

Note that this code assumes that you're using the `io.netty.handler.ssl.TlsClientContextBuilder` class to build the `TLSClientContext` instance. If you're using a different class, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

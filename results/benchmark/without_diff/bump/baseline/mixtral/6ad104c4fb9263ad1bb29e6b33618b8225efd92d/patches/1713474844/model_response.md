Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;

import java.security.GeneralSecurityException;
import java.security.Security;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // ...

    static {
        try {
            Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

This patch adds a static block to initialize the Bouncy Castle provider, which should be present as an external dependency. This should resolve the "package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls does not exist" error.

Note that this patch assumes you have added the Bouncy Castle library to your project. If you haven't, you will need to do so by adding the appropriate dependency in your build system (e.g., Maven or Gradle).

For example, if you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.71</version>
</dependency>
```

Or if you are using Gradle, you can add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.71'
```

Make sure to replace the version number with the latest version of the library if necessary.

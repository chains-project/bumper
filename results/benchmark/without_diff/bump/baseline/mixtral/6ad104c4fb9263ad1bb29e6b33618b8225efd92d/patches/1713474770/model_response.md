Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsUtils;

// ...

@Override
public void decode(InputStream in, ByteQueue queue) throws IOException {
    int tag = in.read();
    if (tag == TlsUtils.ApplicationData) {
        byte[] data = TlsUtils.readOpaque16(in);
        queue.advance(data.length);
        queue.putBytes(data, 0, data.length);
    } else {
        throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.unexpected_message);
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the problematic import statement with the correct one for the Bouncy Castle library. I also added an import statement for the `TlsUtils` class, which is used in the `decode` method.

I made sure not to use any removed library methods, and to keep the function signature unchanged. I also added a missing import statement for `AlertDescription`.

Note that this patch assumes that the Bouncy Castle library is available on the classpath, and that its version includes the `TlsUtils` class. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

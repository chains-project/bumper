Here's a possible patch for the given failing code. This patch replaces the missing package import with a try-catch block to handle the missing dependency.

```java
try {
    import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle the missing dependency here
    // For example, you can log an error message or use a different implementation
    System.err.println("Error importing org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

This patch checks if the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription` class is available at runtime. If it's not available, the patch logs an error message and continues execution.

Note that this patch may not be suitable for all use cases, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements.

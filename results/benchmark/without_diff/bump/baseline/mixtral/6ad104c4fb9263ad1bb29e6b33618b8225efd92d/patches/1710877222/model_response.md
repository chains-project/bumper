Based on the error message, it seems that there is an issue with a line of code that uses the Bouncy Castle library. The error message is indicating that there is a missing semicolon, but I suspect that the issue might be due to the use of a method or class that has been removed from the version of the library being used.

Without the full code of the `ChachaDecoder` class, it's difficult to provide a definitive solution. However, based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the import statement for the Bouncy Castle library.

One possible solution could be to update the import statement to use a different class from the Bouncy Castle library that provides similar functionality. For example, instead of using `JceTls`, we could use `TlsJceProvider`:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.TlsJceProvider;
```
If this class is not available or does not provide the necessary functionality, another option could be to use a different library that provides TLS/SSL functionality. For example, we could use the `JSSE` provider that is included in the JDK:
```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLServerSocketFactory;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory;

// ...

SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), null);
SSLServerSocketFactory sslServerSocketFactory = sslContext.getServerSocketFactory();
```
Note that the above code is just an example and may need to be adapted to fit the specific use case.

In summary, the proposed patch for the failing code could be:

Replace:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;
```
with:
```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLServerSocketFactory;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory;

// ...

SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), null);
SSLServerSocketFactory sslServerSocketFactory = sslContext.getServerSocketFactory();
```
Or, alternatively:

Replace:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;
```
with:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.TlsJceProvider;
```
Note that the second option may not work if the `TlsJceProvider` class is not available or does not provide the necessary functionality.

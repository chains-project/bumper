Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;

import java.security.Security;

// add this block before using any classes from org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls package
if (Security.getProvider(BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME) == null) {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
}
```
The failure is caused by the missing `BouncyCastle` provider in the `Security` class. The above code checks if the provider is already added, and if not, adds it. After adding this block, the code should compile and run successfully.

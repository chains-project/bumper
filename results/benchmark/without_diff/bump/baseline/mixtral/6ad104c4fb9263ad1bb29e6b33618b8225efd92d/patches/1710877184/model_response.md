Based on the provided information, it seems the error message is indicating a syntax error in the specified line of code. Specifically, it's expecting a ';' after the import statement. However, looking at the import statement itself, it seems to be correct.

Therefore, I would suggest adding a dummy statement after the import statement to satisfy the syntax requirement. Here's the patched code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JceTls;
; // add this line to satisfy syntax requirement
```
This should fix the syntax error and allow the code to compile. However, it's important to note that this is just a workaround for the compilation error, and the root cause of the issue may still need to be addressed. Specifically, it's possible that there is a compatibility issue between the version of the Bouncy Castle library being used and the version of the Java runtime or other libraries in use. It may be necessary to upgrade or downgrade the library version or make other changes to the code to ensure compatibility.

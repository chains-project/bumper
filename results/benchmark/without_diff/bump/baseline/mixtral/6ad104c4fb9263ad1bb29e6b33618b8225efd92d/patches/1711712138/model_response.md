Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    public byte[] decode(byte[] data, byte[] key, byte[] iv) {
        try {
            Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("ChaCha20-Poly1305");
            SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, "ChaCha20");
            IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
            cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keySpec, ivSpec);
            return cipher.doFinal(data);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```
The original code was missing the necessary import statements for the `Cipher`, `SecretKeySpec`, and `IvParameterSpec` classes from the `javax.crypto` package. These import statements have been added to the fixed code.

Additionally, the original code was using the string `"ChaChaDecoder"` as the algorithm name for the `Cipher` object. This has been corrected to `"ChaCha20-Poly1305"`.

Finally, the original code was missing a try-catch block around the creation and initialization of the `Cipher` object. This has been added to the fixed code to handle any exceptions that may occur during the creation and initialization of the `Cipher` object.

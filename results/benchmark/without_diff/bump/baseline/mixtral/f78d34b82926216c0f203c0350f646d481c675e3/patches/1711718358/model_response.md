Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;

//...

String randomString = RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(10);
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `import` statement. Specifically, the `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils` class cannot be found. This is likely because the version of the Apache Commons Lang library being used is different from the one that the code was written against.

To fix the issue, we can remove the static import statement and instead create a local variable `randomString` to hold the result of calling the `randomAlphanumeric` method. This way, we are no longer relying on the static import statement and the code should compile correctly.

Note that the argument `10` passed to the `randomAlphanumeric` method is just an example, and can be adjusted as needed.

Here is a patch for the given code:
```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;

//...

String randomString = RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(10);
```
Explanation:
The issue is caused by the fact that the static import statement is not needed and is causing a syntax error. Instead, I have imported the entire `RandomStringUtils` class and created a variable `randomString` to store the result of the `randomAlphanumeric` method.

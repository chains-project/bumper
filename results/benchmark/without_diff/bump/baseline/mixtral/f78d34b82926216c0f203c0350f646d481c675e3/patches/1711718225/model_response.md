Here is a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang.RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric;
```

The error is caused by the wrong import statement, which should be changed to the above line.
The `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils` class has been moved to the `org.apache.commons.lang` package in a newer version of the library.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isBlank;

@Override
public CreateJFrogInstanceStepExtend newInstance(Map<String, Object> arguments) {
    // existing code here

    String url = (String) args.get("url");
    if (isBlank(url)) { // use isBlank instead of isAllBlank
        throw new MissingRequiredField("url", "create", "jfrog instance", "url");
    }

    // remaining code here
}
```
The `isAllBlank` method was removed in a later version of the `commons-lang3` library, and was replaced with the `isBlank` method. The `isBlank` method checks if a string is null, empty, or consists only of whitespace characters. In this case, it can be used instead of `isAllBlank` to check if the `url` argument is empty or null.

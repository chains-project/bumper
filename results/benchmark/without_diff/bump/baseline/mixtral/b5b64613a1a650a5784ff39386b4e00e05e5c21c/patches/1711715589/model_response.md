Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a fixed version of the failing method that should resolve the error:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isBlank;

@Override
public Boolean isAllBlank(final @CheckForNull String string) {
    return isBlank(string) && isBlank(string);
}
```
In this version, I replaced the problematic import statement with a corrected one that imports the `isBlank` method from the same library. I then implemented the `isAllBlank` method by calling `isBlank` twice on the input string. This should achieve the same functionality as the original method while avoiding the dependency error.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input string is not null. If null inputs are possible, you may want to add null checks to ensure that the method behaves as expected.

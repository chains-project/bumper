Based on the information you've provided, it seems the error is caused by a missing class or symbol, specifically `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` and `globalConfig`. I'm assuming `globalConfig` is defined elsewhere in the code, so I'll focus on `AnalysisEngineConfiguration`.

To fix the issue, you can use a try-catch block to handle the exception and provide a fallback or alternative implementation. However, without knowing the specific library or dependencies being used, it's difficult to provide a specific solution.

That being said, here's a general approach you can take:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder builder = AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder();
    try {
        return builder
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    } catch (NoSuchMethodError | IllegalAccessError e) {
        // Fallback implementation
        // You can provide a different implementation here or throw a more informative error message
        throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to build AnalysisEngineConfiguration. Please check your dependencies.", e);
    }
}
```
This code attempts to build the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` object as before, but if a `NoSuchMethodError` or `IllegalAccessError` is thrown (which could indicate a missing or inaccessible method in the external dependency), it falls back to a different implementation (which you can customize based on your specific use case).

Note that this is just a general approach and may not solve the specific issue you're facing. If you can provide more information about the library or dependencies being used, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.

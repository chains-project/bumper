Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    DependencyManager dependencyManager = new DefaultDependencyManager();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(dependencyManager.createModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider()))
            .build();
}
```

In this patch, I added a new variable `dependencyManager` to manage the dependencies. Instead of using `globalConfig.getModulesProvider()` directly, I use `dependencyManager.createModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())` to create the modules provider. This is because the error message suggests that the failure is caused by an external dependency, so I assume that the `ModulesProvider` class may have been updated and requires a different initialization method.

Note that I made this assumption based on the error message and the code provided. Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the failure. Therefore, this patch may not solve the problem, and further investigation may be necessary.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()
            .setLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

In this patch, I have replaced the use of the `addEnabledLanguages` method with the `setLanguages` method, as the former may no longer be available in the updated version of the external dependency. I have also replaced the use of the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` method with the `new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()` constructor, as the former may no longer be available in the updated version of the external dependency. These changes should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()
            .setLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the usage of `addEnabledLanguages` method with `setLanguages` method, as it seems that the `addEnabledLanguages` method is no longer available in the updated version of the library.

Note that I assumed that the `globalConfig` object is still available in the client code and it still has the same methods as before.

Also, note that I removed the `builder()` method call since the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` class has a default constructor that can be used to create a new builder instance.

Finally, note that I used the `setLanguages` method instead of the `addEnabledLanguages` method because the former method sets the list of enabled languages, while the latter method appends the given list of languages to the existing list of enabled languages. Since the `addEnabledLanguages` method is no longer available, it's likely that the library developers intended to replace it with the `setLanguages` method.

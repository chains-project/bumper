I cannot determine which libraries have been added or removed, so I will assume that no methods have been removed and that the `StringContains` constructor not taking a `boolean` parameter has been added. Here is a possible patch:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
  if (StringUtils.isBlank(image)) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Image name cannot be blank");
  }
  return new StringContains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

This version of the method checks if the image name is not blank before creating the `StringContains` matcher. It uses the `StringUtils.isBlank` method to check if the image name is blank or not, which is a more robust way of checking if a string is empty or whitespace.

The `StringUtils` class is part of the Apache Commons Lang library, so make sure that it is included in the project dependencies before using this method. If this library is not available, you can replace the `StringUtils.isBlank` method with an equivalent implementation.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new PatternMatcher(
        "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image,
        Pattern.LITERAL
    );
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `StringContains` matcher with a `PatternMatcher` that uses a regular expression to match the desired string. This avoids the issue with the `StringContains` constructor and allows the code to compile and run successfully.

I cannot see the full code, but I can still provide a possible fix for the given function. It seems like the error message is saying that the `StringContains` constructor does not accept a `String` parameter, but only a `CharSequence` one. Here's a possible patch:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    CharSequence sequence = String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
    return new StringContains(false, sequence);
}
```
This code creates a `CharSequence` variable from the `String` parameter by calling the `String.format` method. Then, it passes the `sequence` variable to the `StringContains` constructor.

Note that the `StringContains` constructor takes two arguments: a `boolean` indicating whether the match should be case-sensitive and a `CharSequence` to match. The first argument is set to `false` to indicate a case-insensitive match.

If you're using an older version of Hamcrest that doesn't support the `CharSequence` overload of `StringContains`, you can create a `String` from the `CharSequence` and use that instead:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    CharSequence sequence = String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
    return new StringContains(false, sequence.toString());
}
```
This code creates a new `String` from the `CharSequence` by calling the `toString` method. Then, it passes the new `String` to the `StringContains` constructor.

Note that this code assumes that the `StringContains` constructor that takes a `String` argument is still available in the Hamcrest version being used. If not, you may need to upgrade to a newer version of Hamcrest or find a different way to create a matcher for the `CharSequence`.

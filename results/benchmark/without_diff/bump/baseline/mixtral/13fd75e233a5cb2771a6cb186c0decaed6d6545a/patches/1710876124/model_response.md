I understand that you want a fixed version of the `imagePulled` method, I will make the assumption that the `StringContains` class expects a `CharSequence` as its first argument, instead of a `String`. Here is the fixed version of the method:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    CharSequence sequence = String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
    return new StringContains(false, sequence);
}
```
This should resolve the compilation error.

`String.format` returns a `String`, which is a subtype of `CharSequence`, so this should work without any issues.

Please note that this solution assumes that the `StringContains` constructor is not overloaded and that the constructor with a single `CharSequence` argument is the one that is intended to be used. If that's not the case, additional information would be needed to provide a more accurate solution.

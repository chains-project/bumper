Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Status: Downloaded newer image for"
    );
}
```

In this patch, I added a new parameter `subString` to the `StringContains` constructor. This parameter is used to match the prefix of the expected string. In this case, I set it to "Status: Downloaded newer image for" to match the prefix of the expected string.

Note: This patch assumes that the `StringContains` constructor with the `subString` parameter is available in the new version of the library. If it's not, you may need to use a different approach to fix the error.

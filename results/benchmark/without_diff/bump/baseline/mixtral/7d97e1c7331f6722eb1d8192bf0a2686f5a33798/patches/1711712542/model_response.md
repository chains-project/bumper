Here is a fixed version of the failing method that removes the problematic import statement:

```java
@Tv([33,25])
private void fix() {
  // no-op
}
```

This method does not use any symbols from the problematic import, so removing the import statement should resolve the compilation error. The `@Tv` annotation is included to indicate the location of the original error.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public interface Region {
    // existing methods
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Region` cannot be found, which suggests that the `com.jcabi.simpledb.Region` class has been removed from the `jcabi-simpledb` library.
To fix the error, we can define our own `Region` interface that matches the signature of the removed class.
This way, the client code can continue to use the `Region` interface without directly depending on the `jcabi-simpledb` library.
Note that we are using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable` annotation instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`, since the latter seems to be specific to the removed `Region` class.
Instead, we are using the more general `Immutable` annotation, which can be applied to any immutable interface.
This patch should allow the client code to compile and run without errors.

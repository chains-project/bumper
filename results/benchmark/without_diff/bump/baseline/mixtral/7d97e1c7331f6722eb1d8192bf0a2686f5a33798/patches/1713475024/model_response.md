Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class RegionITCase {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`. We then annotate the `RegionITCase` class with `@Loggable` to enable logging for the class.

This patch assumes that the `com.jcabi.aspects` library is still available and that the `Loggable` aspect is present in the version of the library that you're using. If this is not the case, you may need to find a different way to fix the error.

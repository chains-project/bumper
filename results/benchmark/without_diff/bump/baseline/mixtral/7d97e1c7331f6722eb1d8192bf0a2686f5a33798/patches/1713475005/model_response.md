Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found, which suggests that the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` library method is no longer available. A possible solution is to replace the use of `Tv` with another method from the same library. In this case, I have chosen to use the `Loggable` aspect, which can provide similar functionality to `Tv`.
Note that I have added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, and set the log level to `DEBUG`. You may need to adjust the log level to suit your needs.
Also note that I have removed the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`, since it is no longer needed.
Finally, I have not made any changes to the method signature, as specified in the instructions.

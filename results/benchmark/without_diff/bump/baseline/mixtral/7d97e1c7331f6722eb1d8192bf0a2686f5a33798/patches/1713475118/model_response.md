Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the problematic import statement with a new one that imports the `Immutable` aspect from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We then annotated the `RegionITCase` class with the `@Immutable` annotation.

Note that this patch assumes that the `RegionITCase` class does not need to be mutable. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly. Additionally, this patch assumes that the `com.jcabi.simpledb` package has been updated in a way that breaks compatibility with the original code. The new version of the package may have a different way of implementing the functionality that was previously provided by the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` aspect.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found, which is part of the `jcabi-aspects` library. Since the error is caused by an external dependency, we cannot directly fix the issue in the library. However, we can find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality provided by the missing symbol.

In this case, the `Tv` aspect is used to log the execution time of a method. We can replace it with the `Loggable` aspect, which provides similar functionality. By adding the `@Loggable` annotation with the `Loggable.DEBUG` parameter, we can log the execution time of the method at the debug level.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of the code in the `RegionITCase` class is correct and does not need to be changed.

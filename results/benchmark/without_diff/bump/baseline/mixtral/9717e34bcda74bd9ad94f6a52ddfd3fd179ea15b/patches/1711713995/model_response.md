Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

public class MkGithub {
    protected Github github() {
        return new Github("your-github-token-here");
    }
}
```

In this patch, we've replaced the import statement for `com.jcabi.github.mock.MkGithub` with `com.jcabi.github.Github`. The `MkGithub` class has been deprecated in favor of the `Github` class, which provides a simpler and more flexible interface for working with the GitHub API.

We've also added a new method `github()` that returns a new instance of `Github` initialized with a GitHub token. This method can be used to authenticate API requests and access private repositories.

Note that this patch assumes that you have a valid GitHub token that you can use to authenticate API requests. If you don't have a token, you can create one by following the instructions in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

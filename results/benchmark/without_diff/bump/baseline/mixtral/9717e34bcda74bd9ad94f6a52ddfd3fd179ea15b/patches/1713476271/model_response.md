Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(40)
public class MkGithub {
    private final Github github;

    public MkGithub() {
        this.github = new Github();
    }

    // existing methods...
}
```
In this patch, we've replaced the import statement for the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation with the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class. We've also changed the constructor to create a new `Github` instance instead of the original `MkGithub` instance.

Note that we've kept the `@Tv(40)` annotation on the `MkGithub` class, assuming that it was being used for a specific purpose. If this annotation is not needed, you can remove it.

Additionally, we've kept the existing methods of the `MkGithub` class unchanged.

This patch should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by using a different class from the `jcabi` library that is still available.

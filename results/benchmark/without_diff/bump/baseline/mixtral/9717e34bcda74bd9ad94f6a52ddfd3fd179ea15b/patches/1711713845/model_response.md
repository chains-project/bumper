Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;
import com.jcabi.github.mock.MkGithub;

public class FixedMkGithub extends MkGithub {
    public FixedMkGithub(Github github) {
        super(github);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The error message indicates that the symbol `MkGithub` cannot be found, so we need to import the correct class.
* I assumed that the `MkGithub` class is still available in the new version of the library, but it might have been moved to a different package.
* I created a new class `FixedMkGithub` that extends `MkGithub` and imports `Github` from the new package.
* I added a constructor that takes a `Github` object as a parameter and passes it to the superclass constructor.
* This patch should fix the compilation error and allow the client code to work with the new version of the library.

Note: This is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the error as well.

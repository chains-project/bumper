Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

public class MkGithub {

    protected Github github() {
        return new Github("your-github-token-here");
    }

}
```
Explanation:

* The failing code imports a class from the `jcabi-aspects` library, which has been removed in the new version.
* The `jcabi-github` library, which the failing code depends on, has been updated to use the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class from the `jcabi-github` library directly, instead of the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) technique used by the `jcabi-aspects` library.
* Therefore, the patch replaces the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with a `com.jcabi.github.Github` import, and uses the `Github` class to create a new `Github` instance, passing in a GitHub access token as a constructor argument.
* This allows the client code to authenticate with the GitHub API and perform GitHub-related operations.
* Note that the `MkGithub` class in the failing code is a subclass of the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class from the `jcabi-github` library, so the `github()` method returns an instance of the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class.
* However, the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class from the `jcabi-github` library is not an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) proxy, but a regular Java class that provides a programmatic interface to the GitHub API.
* This means that the client code can use the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class directly, without the need for the AOP techniques provided by the `jcabi-aspects` library.
* Therefore, the patch removes the `@Override` annotation from the `github()` method, as it is not overriding any method in the new version.
* Note that the patch assumes that the client code has a valid GitHub access token, which should be replaced with the actual token value.
* The patch also assumes that the client code does not use any of the removed methods or classes from the `jcabi-aspects` library, as the patch only imports and uses classes from the `jcabi-github` library.
* If the client code uses any removed methods or classes from the `jcabi-aspects` library, the client code may need to be refactored to use the equivalent methods or classes from the `jcabi-github` library, or provide alternative implementations that achieve the same functionality.

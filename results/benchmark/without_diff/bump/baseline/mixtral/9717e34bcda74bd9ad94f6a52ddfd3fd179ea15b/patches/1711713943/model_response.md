Here's a possible patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

public class MkGithub {
    protected Github github() {
        return new Github("your-github-token-here");
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the problematic import statement with a new one for `com.jcabi.github.Github`. I've also added a new method `github()` that creates a new instance of `Github` using a GitHub token. You should replace `"your-github-token-here"` with your actual GitHub token.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of your code is using the `Github` class to interact with the GitHub API. If your code is using a different class or method from the `com.jcabi.github` package, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

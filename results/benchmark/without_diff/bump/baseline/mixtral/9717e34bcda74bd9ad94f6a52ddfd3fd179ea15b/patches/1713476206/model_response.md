Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(40)
public class MkGithub {
    private final Github github;

    public MkGithub() {
        this.github = new Github();
    }

    // rest of the class
}
```
This patch replaces the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with `com.jcabi.github.Github`, and creates a new instance of `Github` using its default constructor. The `Tv` annotation is kept in place, but it's possible that it won't be needed depending on the specific use case.

Here is a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(40)
public class MkGithub {
    private final Github github;

    public MkGithub(String token) {
        this.github = new Github(token);
    }

    // rest of the class code
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the import statement for the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class with the import statement for the `com.jcabi.github.Github` class. This is because the `com.jcabi.aspects` package has been removed in the new version of the library, and the `com.jcabi.github` package is the new location for the `Github` class.

I also added a new `github` field to the `MkGithub` class and initialized it in the constructor using the `Github` class constructor that takes a `String` argument. This is because the `MkGithub` class was using a `Github` instance in its methods, and the `Github` instance needs to be created somehow.

Note that the `Tv` annotation has been kept in the `MkGithub` class to ensure that the `Tv` annotation is still applied to the class. The `Tv` annotation has been updated to version 40 to match the version of the `com.jcabi.aspects` package that was removed in the new version of the library.

This patch should fix the "cannot find symbol" error for the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class by using the new location for the `Github` class and initializing a `Github` instance in the `MkGithub` class.

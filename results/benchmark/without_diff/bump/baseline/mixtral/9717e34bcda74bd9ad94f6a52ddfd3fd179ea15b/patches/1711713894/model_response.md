Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Override
public Github github() {
    return new Github("https://github.com");
}
```

This version of the method creates a new `Github` object using the constructor that takes a string argument for the GitHub API endpoint. This constructor was added in a newer version of the library, which is why the original code is causing a "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that this version of the method does not override any method in the new version of the library, so it is not necessary to include the `@Override` decorator.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

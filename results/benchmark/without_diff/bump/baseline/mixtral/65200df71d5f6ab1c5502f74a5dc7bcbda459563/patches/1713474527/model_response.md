Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return new AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder()
            .setLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

In this patch, I have replaced the use of the `addEnabledLanguages` method, which seems to have been removed, with the `setLanguages` method, which has been added in the new version. I have also replaced the use of the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder` method with the constructor for `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder`, which has been added in the new version. Additionally, I have removed the `Override` decorator, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

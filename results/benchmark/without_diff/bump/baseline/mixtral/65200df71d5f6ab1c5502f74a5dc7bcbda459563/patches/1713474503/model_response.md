Here's a possible patch for the given code. It introduces a new variable `workDir` to ensure that the method call `globalConfig.getWorkDir()` is only called once, and the result is stored in a variable. This can help to avoid issues with external dependencies that may be causing the failure.
```java
    private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
        String workDir = globalConfig.getWorkDir();
        return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                .setWorkDir(workDir)
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    }
```
Note that this patch assumes that the issue is caused by the method call `globalConfig.getWorkDir()`, but if the issue is caused by a different method, a different patch may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch for the given code. It creates a new `FileWorkDir` instance if the `WorkDir` is a file, ensuring the required class is used even if it was removed in the new version.

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    File workDir = null;
    if (globalConfig.getWorkDir() instanceof File) {
        workDir = (File) globalConfig.getWorkDir();
    } else {
        workDir = new File(globalConfig.getWorkDir().getPath());
    }

    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(workDir)
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

This code assumes that the failure is caused by the `WorkDir` class being removed, and that `File` is a suitable replacement. If the issue is different, this code might not fix the error.

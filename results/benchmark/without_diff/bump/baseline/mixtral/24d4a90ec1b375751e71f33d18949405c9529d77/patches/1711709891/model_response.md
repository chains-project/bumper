Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private final S3 s3 = S3.create();
    // existing code goes here
}
```
In this patch, I have replaced the problematic import statement with an equivalent one that imports the `S3` class from the `jcabi-s3` library. I have then created a new instance of the `S3` class and assigned it to a new instance variable `s3`. This allows you to continue using the `S3` class in your code.

Note that I have removed the `@Override` decorator from the `testGetObject` method, as it is not overriding any method in the new version. I have also removed the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import statement, as it is no longer needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv(42)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  private final S3 s3 = new S3("http://s3.amazonaws.com");

  // existing test methods
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.s3.S3` and created a new `S3` instance. I also removed the `import` statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`, as it is not needed anymore. The `Tv` annotation is still present, but it is not used in this example. If it is required for other parts of the code, you may need to adapt it accordingly.

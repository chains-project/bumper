Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.Bucket;
import com.jcabi.s3.IOps;
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;
import com.jcabi.s3.VerboseOps;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    ...
    @Test
    @Override
    @ClassRule
    public static final S3 s3 = new S3("http://s3.amazonaws.com",
      new IOps() {
        @Override
        public Bucket getBucket(String bucketName) {
          return new VerboseOps(new AwsClient(awsId, awsKey))
            .bucket(bucketName);
        }
      });
    ...
}
```
Explanation:

* The `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import has been removed, as it is not used in the code.
* The `S3` class is now directly instantiated with an `IOps` implementation that creates a `VerboseOps` instance with the `AwsClient`.
* The `getBucket` method of the `IOps` implementation has been updated to return a `Bucket` instance created by the `VerboseOps` instance.

Note: The above code assumes that the `awsId` and `awsKey` variables are defined and contain the necessary AWS credentials. These variables would need to be defined in the scope of the `AwsOcketITCase` class.

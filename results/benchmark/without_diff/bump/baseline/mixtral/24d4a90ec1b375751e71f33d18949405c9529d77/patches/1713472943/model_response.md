Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;
import com.jcabi.s3.auth.AwsCredentials;

@Tv(42)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private final S3 s3 = new S3(new AwsCredentials() {
        @Override
        public String accessKey() {
            return "your_access_key";
        }

        @Override
        public String secretKey() {
            return "your_secret_key";
        }
    });
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, we've replaced the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with `com.jcabi.s3.S3` and `com.jcabi.s3.auth.AwsCredentials`. We've also added a new `S3` instance that uses an anonymous implementation of `AwsCredentials` to provide the necessary authentication information.

Note that you'll need to replace "your\_access\_key" and "your\_secret\_key" with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

This patch should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by using the new version of the `com.jcabi.s3` library.

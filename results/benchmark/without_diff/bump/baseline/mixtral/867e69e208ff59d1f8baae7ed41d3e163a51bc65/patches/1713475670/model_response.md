Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// ...

public void startLogging(TTransport transport) {
  if (transport instanceof TFramedTransport) {
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = (TFramedTransport) transport;
    // ...
  }
}
```

This patch replaces the import statement with the non-framed version of the Thrift transport and then checks if the transport is an instance of `TFramedTransport`. If it is, it casts it and continues with the rest of the method as before. This approach ensures that the code still functions correctly if the transport is framed, but doesn't rely on the `TFramedTransport` import, which may have been removed in the updated dependency.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

TFramedTransport tFramedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TTransport());
```
In this patch, I have replaced the missing `TFramedTransport` class with a new instance of `TFramedTransport` that takes a `TTransport` instance as a parameter. Since `TTransport` is not a removed library method, we can safely use it here.

Note that this patch assumes that the missing symbol error is caused by a missing dependency for `TFramedTransport`. If that is not the case, then this patch may not work.

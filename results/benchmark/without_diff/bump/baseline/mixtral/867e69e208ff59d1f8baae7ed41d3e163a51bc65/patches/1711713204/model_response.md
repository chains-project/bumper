Here is a potential patch for the failing code:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// Use a different type of transport that is still supported by the library
private TTransport createTransport() {
  return new org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket(host, port);
}
```
This patch replaces the use of the `TFramedTransport` class with the `TSocket` class, which is still supported by the Thrift library. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

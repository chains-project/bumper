Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch that you can apply to the code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class ThriftReader {
    public void readThriftData() throws IOException, ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        TSocket transport = new TSocket("localhost", 9090);
        transport.open();
        // existing thrift code here
        transport.close();
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new import statement for `TSocket`, which is a different class in the same Apache Thrift library. The `TFramedTransport` class has been removed in newer versions of the library, so we cannot use it. Instead, we can use `TSocket` to create a transport for connecting to a Thrift server.

In the `readThriftData` method, we create a new `TSocket` instance, open a connection to the server, and then close the connection after we are done. This should allow you to read data from the Thrift server using the `TSocket` transport.

Note that this patch assumes that you are using a version of the Apache Thrift library that includes the `TSocket` class. If you are using a newer version of the library that has removed `TSocket`, you may need to find a different solution.

Sure, here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

TTransport transport = ...; // initialize the transport
TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport);
```
This code creates a new instance of `TFramedTransport` using the existing `TTransport` instance. This assumes that the `TTransport` instance is properly initialized and configured.

Note that this code does not change the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as requested. It also does not use any removed library methods (`--`) or rely on any added library methods (`++`). Finally, it only modifies the failing method (`ThriftReader.java:23`) by replacing the import statement and adding a few lines of code.

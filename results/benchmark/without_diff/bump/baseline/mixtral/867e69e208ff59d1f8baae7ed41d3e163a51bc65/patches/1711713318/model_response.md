Sure, here is a potential patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

TTransport transport = ...; // initialize the transport object
TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport);
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with one that imports the non-framed transport class. It then creates a transport object (which can be initialized with the appropriate implementation for your use case) and wraps it with a `TFramedTransport` object. This should allow the code to compile and run without issues.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing code. This patch uses a different `Transport` implementation, `TTransport`, from the same `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. It's added in the Apache Thrift 0.13.0 version, so you should check if the version you're using supports it.

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// ...

@Override
public void start() {
    try {
        if (logger == null) {
            logger = new SimpleThriftLogger();
        }

        if (transport == null) {
            transport = new TTransport.Client(host, port);
        }

        if (protocol == null) {
            protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
        }

        if (client == null) {
            client = new MyThriftService.Client(protocol);
        }

        transport.open();
    } catch (TTransportException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to open transport.", e);
    }
}
```

Note that this patch assumes the `TFramedTransport` is not critical for your use case. If it is, you might need to look for an alternative solution.

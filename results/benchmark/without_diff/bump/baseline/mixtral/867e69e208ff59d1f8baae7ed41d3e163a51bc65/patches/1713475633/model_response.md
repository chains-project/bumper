Here's a possible patch for the given failing code. I'm assuming that the error is caused by the missing FramedTransport class from the Thrift library. The patch uses a different transport implementation, `TNonblockingTransport`, which should be available in the same library version.

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TNonblockingTransport;

// ...

public class SimpleThriftLogger implements ThriftLogger {
  // ...

  @Override
  public void startLogging(ThriftLogHandler logHandler) {
    try {
      transport = new TNonblockingTransport(new Socket(host, port));
      protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(transport);
      client = new ThriftLogger.Client(protocol);
      transport.open();
      logHandler.onLoggingStarted();
    } catch (TTransportException | IOException e) {
      logHandler.onError(e);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the `TFramedTransport` with `TNonblockingTransport`. The rest of the code remains unchanged. Make sure to test the code thoroughly, as the behavior of the new transport might differ from the original one.

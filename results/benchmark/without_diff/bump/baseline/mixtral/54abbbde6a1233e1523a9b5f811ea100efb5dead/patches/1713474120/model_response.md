Here's a patch for the failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"1.0"})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```

This patch replaces the import statement with the correct one for the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class. It also removes the `@Override` decorator from the class declaration, as it is not necessary for this case. Note that the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation has been moved to the class level, as it was causing the compilation error.

Here's the fixed failing method:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.1"})
public class SshByPassword {
    protected Ssh ssh() {
        return new Ssh(
            username(),
            host(),
            password()
        );
    }
    // ... rest of the class
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the direct usage of `com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword` with the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class. I also created a new `ssh()` method that initializes an instance of the `Ssh` class using the required parameters.

This should fix the issue with the missing symbol in the original code.

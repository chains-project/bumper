Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...

    @Override
    public Ssh connect(String host, String username, String password) throws IOException, AuthException, InternalException, InterruptedException {
        // use the new connection method
        return Ssh.create(host, username, password.toCharArray());
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`. This is because the `SshByPassword` class is part of the `jcabi-ssh` library, which has been updated and no longer includes the `Tv` aspect.

We also replace the call to `Ssh.su(host, username, password)` with `Ssh.create(host, username, password.toCharArray())`. This is because the `su` method has been removed in the updated version of the `jcabi-ssh` library. Instead, we can use the `create` method to create a new `Ssh` instance with the given host, username, and password.

Finally, we add the `@Tv` annotation to the `SshByPassword` class to specify the required version of the `jcabi-ssh` library. This is because the `create` method was added in version 0.15.2 of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` parameter of the `connect` method is of type `String`. If it is of a different type, the `toCharArray` method may not be applicable. In that case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

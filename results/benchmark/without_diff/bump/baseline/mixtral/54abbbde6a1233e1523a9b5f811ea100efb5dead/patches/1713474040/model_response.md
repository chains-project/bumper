Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1.12})
public class SshByPassword {
    private final Ssh ssh;

    public SshByPassword(String host, int port, String login, String password) {
        this.ssh = Ssh.create(host, port, login, password);
    }

    // existing methods...
}
```

In this patch, we have imported `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. This is because the `com.jcabi.aspects` package has been removed in the newer version of the library.

We have also removed the `@Override` annotation from the constructor, as it was not overriding any method in the first place.

Finally, we have used the `Ssh.create()` method to create an instance of `Ssh`, which has been added in the newer version of the library. This method takes the same parameters as the constructor of `SshByPassword`.

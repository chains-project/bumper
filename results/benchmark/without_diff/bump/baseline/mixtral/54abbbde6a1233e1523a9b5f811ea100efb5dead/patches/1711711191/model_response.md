Here is a fixed version of the failing method that removes the dependency on the problematic `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class:

```java
import java.time.Duration;

// ...

@Override
public Duration timeout() {
    return Duration.ofMinutes(5);
}
```

This version of the method returns a fixed duration of 5 minutes using the `java.time` package, which is a standard Java library and should not cause any dependency issues. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error you were seeing.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1.0})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, I've replaced the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`, since the error message suggests that the issue is with the `com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword` class. I've also added the `@Tv` annotation to the `SshByPassword` class, with a version of 1.0, since the error message suggests that the issue is with a missing symbol in the `SshByPassword` class. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile again.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv(42)
public class SshByPassword {
    protected Ssh ssh;

    public SshByPassword(String host, String username, String password) {
        this.ssh = Ssh.create(host, username, password);
    }

    // existing methods
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement with the correct one for the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class, and then modify the constructor to use the `Ssh.create` method to create an `Ssh` object instead of the removed `SshByPassword.create` method.

Note that we are still using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation, as it does not appear to be causing any issues. We are also not changing the function signature or removing the `@Override` decorator, as they are not causing any issues. Finally, we are not using any removed library methods, as they have been replaced with the `Ssh.create` method.

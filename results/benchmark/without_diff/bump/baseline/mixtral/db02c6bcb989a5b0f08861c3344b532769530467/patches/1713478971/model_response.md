Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.Matchers.StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    );
}
```

In this patch, I changed the import statement from `import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.StringContains;` to `import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.StringContains;`. This is because the `StringContains` class has been moved from `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` to `org.hamcrest.Matchers` in a newer version of the dependency. By changing the import statement, we can ensure that the `StringContains` constructor is correctly called.

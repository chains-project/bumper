Here's a possible patch for the given code:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AbstractStringContains() {
        @Override
        protected String stringContaining(String substring) {
            return String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
        }
    };
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given argument, which is a `String`. This usually means that the constructor is expecting a `Matcher<String>` instead.
To fix this, we can create a new anonymous class that extends `AbstractStringContains` and override the `stringContaining` method to return the expected string.
This should allow the code to compile and run without issues.
Note: I assumed that `AbstractStringContains` is an added library class (`++`) since it's not part of the original code.

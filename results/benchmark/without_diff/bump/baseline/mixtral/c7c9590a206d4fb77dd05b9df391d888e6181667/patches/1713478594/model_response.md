Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

private void renderDecorations(RenderingContext renderingContext, Sink sink) {
    // Replace the original usage of renderingContext with sink
    // ... (rest of the method remains unchanged)
}
```

This patch removes the dependency on the specific `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package by using the more generic `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink` interface. It assumes that the `RenderingContext` instance passed to the method contains a `Sink` instance, which can be used instead.

Note that this patch may not work in all cases, as it depends on the specific implementation of `RenderingContext`. However, it should fix the compilation error and allow the code to run without the problematic dependency.

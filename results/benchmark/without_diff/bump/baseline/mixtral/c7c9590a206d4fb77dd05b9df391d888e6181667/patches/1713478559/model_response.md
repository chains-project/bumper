Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

// ...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    Sink sink = context.createSink();
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `RenderingContext` import with `Sink` from the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink` package. The `RenderingContext` class seems to have been removed from the XHTML decoration module, so we can't use it anymore. Instead, we can use the `Sink` interface, which is still available.

In the `executeReport` method, I replaced the `RenderingContext` instance with the `Sink` instance when creating the sink. This should work as a replacement for the original code.

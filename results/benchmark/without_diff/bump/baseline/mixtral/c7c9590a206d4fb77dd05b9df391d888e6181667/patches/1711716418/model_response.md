Here's a possible patch for the given failing code. This patch removes the failed import statement, as it's not necessary for the code to compile and run correctly.
```java
-import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;
```
This patch assumes that the `RenderingContext` class is not used anywhere else in the code. If it is, then a different solution may be necessary.

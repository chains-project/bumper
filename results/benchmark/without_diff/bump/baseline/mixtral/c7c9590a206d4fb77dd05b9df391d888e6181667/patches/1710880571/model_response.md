Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        generate( sink, locale );
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( java.util.Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

The only change I made was to replace `Locale.ENGLISH` with `java.util.Locale.ENGLISH`. It seems that the `Locale` class in the code was from a different package, and the code was updated to use the `java.util` package instead. This change should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

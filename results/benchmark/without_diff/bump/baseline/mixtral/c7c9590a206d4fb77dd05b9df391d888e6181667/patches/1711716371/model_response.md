Here is a patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.Renderer;

Renderer renderer = new Renderer();
RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext();
// initialize renderingContext with necessary data
renderer.render(document, outputStream, renderingContext);
```
Note: This patch assumes that the `document` and `outputStream` variables are defined and initialized properly. You'll need to modify these variables according to your specific use case.

The failure is caused by the missing package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render`, which seems to have been removed in newer versions of the Doxia library. The `Renderer` class from `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer` package can be used as a replacement.

The `RenderingContext` class is still available in the new version, so it can be used without modifications.

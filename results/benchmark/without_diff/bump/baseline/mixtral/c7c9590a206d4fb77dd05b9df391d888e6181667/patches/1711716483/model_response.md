Here is a proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
    try (Sink sink = new sink.XhtmlSink()) {
        RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext();
        renderingContext.setSink(sink);
        // existing code using renderingContext and sink
    }
}
```
In this patch, we create a new `sink.XhtmlSink` instance using a try-with-resources statement to ensure that it is automatically closed after use. We then create a new `RenderingContext` instance and set its `sink` property to the new `sink` instance. This should allow the existing code that uses the `renderingContext` to continue working as before.

Note that this patch assumes that the `sink` package is still available in the version of the library that the client code has been updated to use. If this is not the case, then a different approach may be necessary.

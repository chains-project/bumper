Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

private void renderDecorations(RenderingContext renderingContext, Sink sink) {
    // ...
}
```

The patch removes the import statement for the non-existent package and updates the method signature to use the `Sink` interface from the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink` package, which is an added library method identified with `++`. This should resolve the error.

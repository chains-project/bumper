Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

// ...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    Sink sink = renderingContext.getDocument().getContent();
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This suggests that the `RenderingContext` class, which was previously part of this package, is no longer available.

To fix this issue, we can use the `Sink` interface provided by the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink` package instead. This interface provides similar functionality to the `RenderingContext` class and can be used to generate the output document.

In the proposed patch, we first import the `Sink` interface, and then replace the `RenderingContext` object with a `Sink` object. We can obtain the `Sink` object by calling the `getDocument().getContent()` method on the `renderingContext` object.

Note that this patch assumes that the `renderingContext` object is still available and has not been removed in the updated version of the external dependency. If this is not the case, additional modifications may be necessary.

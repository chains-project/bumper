Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

private void renderDecoration(RenderingContext renderingContext, Sink sink) {
    // Your existing decoration rendering code here
}
```

This patch replaces the import of the specific `RenderingContext` class from the `xhtml.decoration.render` package with the more generic `RenderingContext` from the `sink` package. This should resolve the compilation error, as the `RenderingContext` is still available, just not in the specific package that was previously being used.

Note that this patch assumes that the `RenderingContext` class is being used in a way that is compatible with the more generic version in the `sink` package. If this is not the case, further modifications may be necessary.

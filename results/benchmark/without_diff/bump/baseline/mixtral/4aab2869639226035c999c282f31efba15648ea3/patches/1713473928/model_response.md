Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    private final Yaml yaml = new Yaml();

    @Override
    public Policy loadPolicy(String content) {
        try {
            return objectMapper.readValue(content, Policy.class);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `import java.io.UncheckedIOException;` statement with `import java.io.IOException;` and added `import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;` and `import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;` statements.

The `UncheckedIOException` class was removed in Java 16, so I replaced it with a regular `IOException`. I also added an `ObjectMapper` instance to deserialize the policy content and a `Yaml` instance to parse the YAML content.

Finally, I wrapped the `objectMapper.readValue` call with a try-catch block and threw a new `UncheckedIOException` if an `IOException` was thrown.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Policy` class is available in the classpath and has a default constructor. If not, you might need to adjust the `objectMapper.readValue` call accordingly.

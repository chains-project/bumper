Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.jayway.jsonpath.DocumentContext;
import com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
  @Override
  public DocumentContext policy(String yaml) {
    try {
      return JsonPath.parse(yaml);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
    }
  }
}
```
The failure is caused by an external dependency update, specifically the `java.io.UncheckedIOException` class, which is no longer present in the updated version of the library. To fix the error, we can handle the `IOException` explicitly and wrap it in a `UncheckedIOException`.

Note: I have assumed that the `com.jayway.jsonpath.DocumentContext` and `com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath` classes are still present in the updated version of the library. If this is not the case, additional changes may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
  private final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

  public com.artipie.security.Policy loadPolicy(File file) {
    try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file)) {
      return mapper.readValue(in, com.artipie.security.Policy.class);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
    }
  }
}
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the missing code, so this patch might not be perfect.
The main changes are:

* Importing the `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` class for reading YAML files.
* Creating an `ObjectMapper` instance for reading YAML files.
* Reading the policy from a file using the `ObjectMapper` and returning it.
* Wrapping any `IOException` that occurs during file reading in an `UncheckedIOException`.

This patch assumes that the `com.artipie.security.Policy` class exists and has a constructor that takes a `java.io.InputStream` argument.
It also assumes that the `YamlPolicyFactory` class exists and has a `loadPolicy` method with the given signature.
If these assumptions are incorrect, then the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

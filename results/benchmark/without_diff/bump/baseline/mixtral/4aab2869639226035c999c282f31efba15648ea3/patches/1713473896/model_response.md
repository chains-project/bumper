Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.yaml.YAMLFactory;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final ObjectMapper mapper;

    public YamlPolicyFactory() {
        this.mapper = new ObjectMapper(new YAMLFactory());
    }

    public ObjectMapper yamlMapper() {
        return this.mapper;
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* The `java.io.UncheckedIOException` import statement was removed, as it is not needed.
* The `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` and `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.yaml.YAMLFactory` imports were added, as they are needed to work with YAML files.
* The `YamlPolicyFactory` class was updated to include a constructor that initializes an `ObjectMapper` instance with a `YAMLFactory`.
* The `yamlMapper()` method was added to return the `ObjectMapper` instance.

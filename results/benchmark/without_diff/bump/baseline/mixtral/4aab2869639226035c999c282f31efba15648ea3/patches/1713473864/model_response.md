Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.jayway.jsonpath.DocumentContext;
import com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath;

public YamlPolicyFactory {
    // existing code

    @Override
    public Policy loadPolicy(byte[] content) {
        DocumentContext jsonContext = null;
        try {
            jsonContext = JsonPath.parse(content);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
        // existing code
    }
}
```

In this patch, I added a try-catch block to handle the IOException that is thrown by the `JsonPath.parse` method. This exception is then wrapped in an UncheckedIOException and re-thrown. This should fix the error you were encountering.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.artipie.asto.Content;
import com.artipie.asto.Key;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    ...
    @Override
    public Policy load(Key key) {
        try (Content content = repo.content(key)) {
            return YAML.loadAs(content.asStream(), Policy.class);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
In this patch, I have imported the `Content` and `Key` classes from the `com.artipie.asto` package, which were missing in the original code. This should fix the error message you mentioned, which was caused by a missing class.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` decorator, as the `load` method is still overriding a method from the superclass. Also, I did not use any removed library methods, and I did not modify the function signature.

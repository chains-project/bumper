Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.jayway.jsonpath.DocumentContext;
import com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPath;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    @Override
    public Policy createPolicy(String yaml) {
        try {
            DocumentContext jsonContext = JsonPath.parse(yaml);
            String version = jsonContext.read("$.version");
            if (version.equals("1.0.0")) {
                return new PolicyV1();
            } else {
                throw new IOException("Unsupported policy version");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
    }
}
```
The patch removes the unused import statement for `java.io.UncheckedIOException`, which is causing the error message. It also adds a try-catch block around the `JsonPath.parse()` method call to handle any `IOException` that may be thrown. If an `IOException` is caught, it is wrapped in a new `UncheckedIOException` and re-thrown.

Note that the patch does not modify the method signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as these are not causing the error message. Additionally, the patch does not use any removed library methods, and it does not use any added library methods that were not already being used in the original code.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @Override
    public Policy loadPolicy(byte[] data) {
        try {
            return objectMapper.readValue(new Yaml().load(data), Policy.class);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
    }
}
```
The patch adds the necessary imports for the Jackson and SnakeYAML libraries, creates an instance of the `ObjectMapper` class from Jackson, and catches the `IOException` that can be thrown when reading the YAML data.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Policy` class is defined elsewhere in your codebase. If that's not the case, you'll need to define it yourself.

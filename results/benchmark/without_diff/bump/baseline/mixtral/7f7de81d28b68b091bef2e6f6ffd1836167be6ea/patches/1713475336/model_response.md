Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) server.getRegistry().clone();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException | CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The patch creates a clone of the registry sorted map using the `clone()` method, which returns an object of the same class as the current object. This way, the cast `(SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>)` is guaranteed to succeed. The `clone()` method is added in Java 1.0, so it should be available in any Java version.

Note that the `CloneNotSupportedException` exception needs to be added to the `catch` block, since it can be thrown by the `clone()` method if the registry object does not implement the `Cloneable` interface. However, since the `SortedMap` interface does not extend the `Cloneable` interface, it is unlikely that the `clone()` method is overridden in the actual implementation class of the registry. Therefore, the `clone()` method should work as expected.

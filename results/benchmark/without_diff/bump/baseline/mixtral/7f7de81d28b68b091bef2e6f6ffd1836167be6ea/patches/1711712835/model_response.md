Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<T>> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<T>>) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The main change I made was to add a explicit cast to `server.getRegistry()` when assigning it to the `reg` variable. This is necessary because the error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between the type of the `reg` variable (`SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<T>>`) and the type of the value returned by `server.getRegistry()` (`SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>`). By adding the explicit cast, we tell the compiler to treat the value returned by `server.getRegistry()` as a `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<T>>`, which should resolve the type mismatch.

I also added a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, because the explicit cast may throw a `ClassCastException` if the value returned by `server.getRegistry()` cannot be cast to `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<T>>`. By adding the `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, we can catch and handle this exception if it occurs.

Note that this patch assumes that the type parameter `T` is a subtype of `ManagedObject`. If this is not the case, then the explicit cast will not compile. In that case, you will need to find a different way to resolve the type mismatch.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) server.getRegistry().clone();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException | CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The change I made is to create a clone of the registry SortedMap, and then modify the clone. This way, the original SortedMap that is stored in the server remains unchanged, and can continue to be used as a SortedMap of `ManagedObject<? extends MODef>`.

Note that I added a `CloneNotSupportedException` catch block, as the `clone()` method can throw this exception. This is because the `SortedMap` interface does not declare that it throws `CloneNotSupportedException`, but the concrete implementation of `SortedMap` that is being used (probably `TreeMap`) does throw this exception.

I also changed the catch block to catch multiple exceptions, as this is a common pattern that can make the code more concise and easier to read.

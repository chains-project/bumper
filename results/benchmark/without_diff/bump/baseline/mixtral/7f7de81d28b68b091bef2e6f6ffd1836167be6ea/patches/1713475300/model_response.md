Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) server.getRegistry().clone();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException | CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The patch creates a copy of the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` by calling the `clone()` method. This creates a new `SortedMap` with the same key-value mappings as the original map, but with a different object identity. This allows the code to modify the copy without affecting the original map.

Note that the `clone()` method is a potential source of problems, as it may not be supported by all classes. In this case, it is assumed that the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` is an instance of a class that supports `clone()`. If this is not the case, a different approach may be needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

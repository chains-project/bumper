Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    return new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
}
```
Explanation:

Since the error message indicates that the symbol `TrustedTagInspector` cannot be found, we can assume that it has been removed in the new version of the library. To fix the error, we can create a new `Yaml` instance with a default `TrustedTagInspector` instance. This way, we are not relying on the external dependency to provide the `TrustedTagInspector` implementation.

Note that this assumes that the `createYaml()` method is not overriding any method in the new version. If it is, you may need to find a different way to create the `Yaml` instance. Additionally, if the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been completely removed from the library, you may need to find a different way to achieve the same functionality.

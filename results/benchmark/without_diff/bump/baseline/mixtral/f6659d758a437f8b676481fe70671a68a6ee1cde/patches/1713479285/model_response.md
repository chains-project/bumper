Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml();
    // configure yaml object if necessary
    return yaml;
}
```

In this patch, we import the `Yaml` class from the `snakeyaml` library instead of the `TrustedTagInspector` class. We then create a `createYaml()` method that returns a new instance of `Yaml`. You can use this method to create a `Yaml` object and configure it as needed.

Note that the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed in newer versions of the `snakeyaml` library, which is why the original code is causing an error. By using the `Yaml` class directly, we can avoid this issue.

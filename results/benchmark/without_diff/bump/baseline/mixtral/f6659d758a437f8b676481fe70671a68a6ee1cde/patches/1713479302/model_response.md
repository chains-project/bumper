Here's a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
    return yaml;
}
```
This patch creates a new `Yaml` instance with a `TrustedTagInspector` instead of trying to import it directly. Note that this assumes that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still available in the version of the library that you are using. If it has been removed, you may need to find an alternative solution.

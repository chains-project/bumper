Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

TrustedTagInspector trustInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
Yaml yaml = new Yaml(trustInspector);
```
This code creates a new `TrustedTagInspector` object and passes it to the `Yaml` constructor. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by providing the necessary implementation for `TrustedTagInspector`.

Note: This solution assumes that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still available at runtime, even if it is not included in the project dependencies. If the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed or renamed, this solution will not work.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected void setUp() throws Exception {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
    // ...
}
```

This patch creates a `Yaml` instance with a `TrustedTagInspector` and assigns it to the `yaml` variable. This should allow the rest of the code to work as before.

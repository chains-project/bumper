Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected void setUp() throws Exception {
    // ...
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
    // ...
}
```

This patch uses the `Yaml` class directly and creates a new `TrustedTagInspector` instance to pass to its constructor. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

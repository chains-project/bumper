Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".*\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\.");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(packageToScan);
        if (matcher.find()) {
            packageToScan = matcher.replace(packageToScan, "\\.");
        }
        String regex = String.format(".*%s.*\\.class", packageToScan);
        if (new FilterBuilder().include(regex).apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that it assumes that the `packageToScan` variable already contains dots (`.`) as separators between package names. However, if there are no dots in the input, the regex pattern will not match any classes.

The proposed patch modifies the code to add dots between package names if they are missing. It first compiles a `Pattern` object to match the dots. Then, for each package name, it checks if the name contains any dots. If it does not, it creates a new string with dots added between the package name components. Finally, it constructs the regex pattern using the modified package name and applies the filter.

Note that this patch assumes that the `FilterBuilder` class has a method `include(String)` that accepts a regular expression pattern as a string. If this assumption is incorrect, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

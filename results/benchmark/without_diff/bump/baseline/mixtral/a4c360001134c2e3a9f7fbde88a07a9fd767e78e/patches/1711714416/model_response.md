Here's a potential fix for the code you provided. It seems like the issue is caused by an external dependency that is no longer available. I'll update the code to not rely on that external dependency.

I changed the way the regex pattern is built, so that it doesn't depend on the external library method `FilterBuilder.include()`. Instead, I used `String.matches()` method, which is a built-in Java method.

```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return s.matches(".+\\.class");
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        String regex = String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan.trim());
        if (s.matches(regex)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This code should now work without the external dependency that was causing the error.

Here's a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\.?\\.??(.*?)\\..+\\.class");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
        while (matcher.find()) {
            if (matcher.group(1).equals(packageToScan)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
The failure is caused by the use of the `include` method from the `FilterBuilder` class, which may have been removed in the updated dependency. To fix the issue, we can use a regular expression to match the package name instead of using the `include` method.

In this patch, we use a `Pattern` and `Matcher` to match the package name in the input string `s`. We first compile a regular expression pattern using `Pattern.compile`, and then use the `Matcher.find` method to search for a match in the input string. If a match is found, we check if the matched package name is equal to the current package in the loop, and return `true` if it is. If no match is found after the loop, we return `false`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `FilterBuilder` class and its `include` method have been removed in the updated dependency. If this is not the case, a different approach may be needed.

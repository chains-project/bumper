Here is a potential patch for the given code:
```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getProperty("package.to.scan", "");
    if (packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        String regex = String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan.trim());
        if (new FilterBuilder().include(regex).apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
The changes made are:

* Replaced `System.getenv` with `System.getProperty` to get the value of the `package.to.scan` property. This assumes that the property is set as a system property, rather than an environment variable.
* Added a default value for `packagesToScan` if it is empty or null.
* Added `trim` to `packageToScan` in the regex to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
* Changed the name of the `PACKAGE_TO_SCAN` constant to `package.to.scan` to match the name of the property.
* Added a check for empty `packagesToScan` before splitting it into an array.
* Changed the variable name from `packages` to `packageToScan` to better reflect its value.

Note that these changes assume that the `FilterBuilder` class and its `include` method are still available and unchanged. If that is not the case, further changes may be necessary.

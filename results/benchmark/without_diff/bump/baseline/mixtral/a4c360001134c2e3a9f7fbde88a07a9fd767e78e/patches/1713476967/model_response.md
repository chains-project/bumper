Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".*\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\.?\\.??(.*?)\\..+\\.class");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
        matcher.find();
        String regex = matcher.group(1);
        if (regex.equals(packageToScan)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

The changes I made are:

* Replaced the `include` method call with a regular expression that matches any class file.
* Used a `Pattern` and `Matcher` to extract the package name from the input string.
* Compared the extracted package name with the current package to scan.

Note that this patch assumes that the input string `s` is a class file path. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the regular expression accordingly.

Additionally, I made use of the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes, which are part of the `java.util.regex` package. These classes were added in Java 1.4, so they should be available in most Java environments.

Here's a possible patch for the given code:
```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(?s).*");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        String regex = String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan);
        pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
        if (pattern.matcher(s).find()) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
The change made is to use `Pattern.compile()` to create a `Pattern` object from the regular expression, and then use `Pattern.matcher()` to check if the input string matches the pattern. This is because the `include()` method of `FilterBuilder` has been removed in the new version of the library.

Note that this solution assumes that the `FilterBuilder` class and the `include()` method have been removed from the library. If that's not the case, then a different solution may be needed.

Here's a proposed patch for the `shouldScan` method to fix the error:
```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".*\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    String regex = ".*\\.class";
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        regex = String.format(".+%s.+\\.class", packageToScan.replaceAll("\\.", "\\."));
        FilterBuilder filterBuilder = new FilterBuilder().include(regex);
        if (filterBuilder.apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return new FilterBuilder().include(regex).apply(s);
}
```
The error message indicates that the code is trying to find a symbol that doesn't exist in the codebase. Specifically, the symbol `FilterBuilder` appears to be causing the issue. After examining the code, it seems that the `include` method of `FilterBuilder` is being passed an incorrect regex pattern that is causing the error.

To fix the issue, I added a new variable `regex` to store the base regex pattern that will be used to filter class files. This regex pattern will be updated in the loop to include the current package being scanned.

Additionally, I modified the `include` method call on `FilterBuilder` to use the `regex` variable instead of hardcoding the regex pattern. This ensures that the same regex pattern is used consistently throughout the method.

Finally, I added a new `FilterBuilder` instance and `include` method call after the loop to ensure that the base regex pattern is applied to the input string `s` before returning from the method.

Overall, these changes should fix the error and ensure that the method correctly filters class files based on the specified package patterns.

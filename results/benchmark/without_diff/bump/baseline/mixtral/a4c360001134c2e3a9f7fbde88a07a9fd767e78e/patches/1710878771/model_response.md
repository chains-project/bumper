Here's a patch to fix the failing `shouldScan` method:

```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".*\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    String regex = ".*\\.class";
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        packageToScan = packageToScan.trim();
        if (packageToScan.isEmpty()) continue;
        regex = String.format(".*\\.%s\\..*\\.class", packageToScan);
        FilterBuilder filterBuilder = new FilterBuilder().include(regex);
        if (filterBuilder.apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return new FilterBuilder().include(regex).apply(s);
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the regex used for matching the package name does not account for the case where the package name is empty or whitespace. The updated code handles this case by adding a check for empty or whitespace package names, and skipping them if that's the case.

The regex used for matching the class name has also been simplified to `.*\\.class` to match any class name.

Finally, the regex is now defined before the loop, and is updated inside the loop before being passed to the `FilterBuilder`. This is to ensure that the regex is using the latest package name.

Note that the `FilterBuilder` class and the `include` method are assumed to be unchanged, and are not shown in the updated code.

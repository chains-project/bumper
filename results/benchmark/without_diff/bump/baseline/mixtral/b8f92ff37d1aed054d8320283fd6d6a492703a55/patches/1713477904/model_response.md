Sure, here's a possible patch for the code:
```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    Collection<JavaFile> javaFiles = directoryScanner.scan().getMatchingFiles();
    List<String> classNames = new ArrayList<>();
    for (JavaFile javaFile : javaFiles) {
        classNames.add(javaFile.getQualifiedName());
    }
    return classNames;
}
```
In this patch, we first scan the directory to get a collection of `JavaFile` objects. Then, we iterate through the collection to get the qualified name of each Java file and add it to a list of class names. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by using the `JavaFile` class, which is an added library method identified with `++`.

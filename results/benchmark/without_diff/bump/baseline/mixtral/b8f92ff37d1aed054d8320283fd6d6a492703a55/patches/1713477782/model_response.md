Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    List<String> classes = new ArrayList<>();
    for (File file : directoryScanner.scan().getMatchingFiles()) {
        classes.add(file.getAbsolutePath());
    }
    return classes;
}
```

This patch uses a `for` loop to iterate over the matching files returned by `directoryScanner.scan()`, and adds the absolute path of each file to a `List<String>` called `classes`. This approach avoids the need to use the `getClasses()` method, which may no longer be available in the updated version of the external dependency.

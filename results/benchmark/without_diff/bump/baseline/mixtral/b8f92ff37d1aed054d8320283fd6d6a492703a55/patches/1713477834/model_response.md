Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    Collection<String> classes = directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
    List<String> classesList = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String clazz : classes) {
        classesList.add(clazz);
    }
    return classesList;
}
```

This patch creates a new list of strings and adds each class to it. This way, the original list returned by `directoryScanner.scan().getClasses()` is not modified and can still be used by other parts of the code.

Note that the `DirectoryScanner` class and the `getWildcard()` method are not modified in this patch. If these are the source of the error, then a different approach might be necessary.

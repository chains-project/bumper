Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    directoryScanner.scan();
    File[] files = directoryScanner.getIncludedFiles();
    List<String> classes = new ArrayList<>();
    for (File file : files) {
        classes.add(file.getAbsolutePath().replace(testSrcFolder.getAbsolutePath() + File.separator, "").replace(File.separator, ".")+".class");
    }
    return classes;
}
```

This patch uses the `DirectoryScanner` class to find the included files, then manually constructs the list of class names by iterating over the files and using the `getAbsolutePath` method to get the full path of each file. The path is then modified to remove the prefix of the testSrcFolder and replace the file separator with a dot to form a valid class name.

Note that this patch assumes that the files found by the `DirectoryScanner` are indeed classes and not other types of files. If that is not the case, additional checks may be necessary.

Here is a possible patch for the code:
```java
  @Override
  public Slice slice(final String action) {
    Set<Authentication.User> users = Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB)
        .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    return new DockerSlice(
        new AstoDocker(new InMemoryStorage()),
        new Permissions.Single(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), action),
        new BearerAuthScheme(
            token -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 
                users.stream()
                    .filter(user -> token.equals(token(user)))
                    .map(user -> new Authentication.User(user.name()))
                    .findFirst()
                    .orElse(null)
            ),
            ""
        )
    );
  }
```
In this patch, I created a variable `users` to store the set of users (`TestAuthentication.ALICE` and `TestAuthentication.BOB`), so that it can be reused in the `BearerAuthScheme` constructor.

I also changed the `completedFuture` method to `supplyAsync` in order to use the `Stream.of` method, which is an added method in Java 8.

Finally, I replaced the `findFirst()` method with `findFirst().orElse(null)` to handle the case where no user is found.

Note that the `@Override` decorator is still present, as the method is still overriding a method in the new version.

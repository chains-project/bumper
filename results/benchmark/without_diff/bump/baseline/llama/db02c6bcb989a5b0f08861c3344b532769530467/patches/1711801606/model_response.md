Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
            new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
            new StringContains(true, "pulling image " + image + " failed")
    );
}
```
This patch creates a new `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers. The first matcher checks for the presence of the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image, and the second matcher checks for the presence of the string "pulling image " + image + " failed". The `AllOf` matcher returns true if both of its component matchers return true, which means that the image has been pulled and the pulling failed.

This patch should fix the error because it removes the need for the `String.format` method, which is not available in the older version of the Java API that the code is compiled against.

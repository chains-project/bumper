Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            "pullImage"
        )
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containing string, and the second is a `String` that represents the contained string. In this case, the error message indicates that the types don't match.

The fix is to change the second parameter of the `StringContains` constructor to a `String` that represents the contained string. Instead of passing `false` as the second parameter, we pass a string that contains the substring "pullImage".

This change should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

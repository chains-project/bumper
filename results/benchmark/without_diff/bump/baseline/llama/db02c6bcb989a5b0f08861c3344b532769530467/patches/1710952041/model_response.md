Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            " Pulled"
        )
    );
}
```
The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because `StringContains` expects a single string argument representing the expected substring, whereas the code passes a format string with multiple placeholders.


The proposed patch uses the `AllOf` matcher, which allows combining multiple matchers. We create two `StringContains` matchers, one for the "Status: Downloaded newer image" string and another for the " Pulled" string. The `AllOf` matcher ensures that both matchers must match for the input string to be considered a match.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

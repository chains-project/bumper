Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;

// Create a variable to hold the RenderingContext instance
RenderingContext renderingContext = null;

// Check if the renderingContext is not null before using it
if (renderingContext != null) {
    // Your code that uses renderingContext here
}
```

The patch creates a variable called `renderingContext` to hold the `RenderingContext` instance and checks if it's not null before using it. This patch aims to fix the error by avoiding the `NullPointerException` that occurs when the `renderingContext` is null.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `RenderingContext` instance is not null when the code is executed. If the `RenderingContext` instance is still null, then this patch will not fix the issue.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;

// Create a variable to hold the RenderingContext instance
RenderingContext renderingContext = null;

// Replace the failing line with the following code
renderingContext = new RenderingContext();
```
This patch creates a variable called `renderingContext` and initializes it with a new instance of `RenderingContext()`. This allows the code to continue executing without the need for the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package, which is not available.

Note that this patch assumes that the `RenderingContext` class is still accessible and has a public constructor. If the `RenderingContext` class has been removed or its constructor is no longer public, this patch will not work and a different approach will be needed.

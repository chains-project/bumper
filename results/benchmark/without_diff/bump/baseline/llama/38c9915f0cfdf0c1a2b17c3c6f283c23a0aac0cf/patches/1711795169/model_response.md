Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = new JoinedText(wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.toString();
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.text` package in the latest version of the library. To fix the error, we can replace the usage of `JoinedText` with `String.join`, like this:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final String wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = String.join(", ", wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets;
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the usage of `JoinedText` with `String.join`, which achieves the same result without relying on a removed library method.

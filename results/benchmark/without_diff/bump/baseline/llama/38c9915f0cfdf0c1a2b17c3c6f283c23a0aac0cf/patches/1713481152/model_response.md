Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... walletNames) {
        this.wallets = JoinedText.join(walletNames);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.asString();
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.text` package in the latest version of the library. To fix the error, we can replace the usage of `JoinedText` with `String.join`, which achieves the same result.

Here's the patched code:
```java
import java.util.StringJoiner;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final String wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... walletNames) {
        StringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(", ");
        for (String walletName : walletNames) {
            joiner.add(walletName);
        }
        this.wallets = joiner.toString();
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets;
    }
}
```
With this patch, the error should be resolved, and the code should compile and run correctly.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = new JoinedText(wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.toString();
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.text` package in the latest version of the Java API. To fix the error, we can replace the import statement with the following:
```scss
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;
```
We can also remove the `Override` annotation, as the `JoinedText` class does not have a `toString()` method that needs to be overridden.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = new JoinedText(wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.toString();
    }
}
```
This code should now compile without any errors related to the `JoinedText` class.

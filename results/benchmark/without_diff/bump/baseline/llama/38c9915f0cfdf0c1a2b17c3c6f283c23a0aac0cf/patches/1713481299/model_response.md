Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = new JoinedText(wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.toString();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the `WalletsIn` class does not override any method in the new version. The `JoinedText` constructor that takes a variable number of `String` arguments is used to create a `JoinedText` object with the `wallets` array. The `getWallets()` method returns the `JoinedText` object's `toString()` method to get the joined text.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText joinedText;

    public WalletsIn(JoinedText joinedText) {
        this.joinedText = joinedText;
    }

    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.text` package in the new version of the dependency. To fix the error, we can simply remove the import statement and the constructor parameter, as the `JoinedText` class is no longer needed.


Here's the patched code:
```java
public class WalletsIn {
    public WalletsIn() {}

    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
This code removes the dependency on the `JoinedText` class and should compile without any issues.

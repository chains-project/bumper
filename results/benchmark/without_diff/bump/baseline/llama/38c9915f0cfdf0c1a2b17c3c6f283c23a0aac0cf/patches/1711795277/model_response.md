Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(JoinedText wallets) {
        this.wallets = wallets;
    }

    public String getWalletNames() {
        return wallets.asString();
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.text` package in the latest version of the library. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;` and remove the `Override` annotation from the `getWalletNames()` method, as it is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

Additionally, we can create a variable `JoinedText wallets` and assign it the value of the `JoinedText` constructor argument, to make the code easier to understand.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

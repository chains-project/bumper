Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = new JoinedText(wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.toString();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the `getWallets()` method is not overriding any method in the new version. The `JoinedText` constructor that takes a varargs parameter is used to initialize the `wallets` field. The `getWallets()` method is modified to call `toString()` on the `JoinedText` object to retrieve the joined text.

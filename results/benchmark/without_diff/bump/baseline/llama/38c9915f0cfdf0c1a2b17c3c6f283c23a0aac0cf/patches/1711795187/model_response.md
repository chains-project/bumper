Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final JoinedText wallets;

    public WalletsIn(String... wallets) {
        this.wallets = new JoinedText(wallets);
    }

    public String getWallets() {
        return wallets.toString();
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `JoinedText` class has been removed from the `org.cactoos.text` package in the latest version of the Java API. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with `import org.cactoos.text.JoinedText;` and remove the `Override` annotation from the `getWallets()` method, as it is not overriding any method in the new version.

Additionally, we can create a variable `JoinedText wallets` to make the code easier to understand.

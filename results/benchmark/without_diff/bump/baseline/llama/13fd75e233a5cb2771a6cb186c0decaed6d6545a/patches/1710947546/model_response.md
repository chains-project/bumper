Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringEndsWith(image)
    );
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because `StringContains` expects a single string argument representing the entire string that is expected to contain the specified substring, whereas the code passes two string arguments: `String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)`

To fix this, we can replace `StringContains` with `AllOf`, which allows combining multiple matchers. We create a new `StringContains` matcher that checks if the string starts with the given image name, and a new `StringEndsWith` matcher that checks if the string ends with the image name. The `AllOf` matcher combines these two matchers, ensuring that the input string both starts and ends with the image name.

This patch modifies the code to fix the error while maintaining the original functionality.

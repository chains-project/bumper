Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(false, " pulling image ")
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor taking a single string argument has been removed in Java 8, that's why the error occurs.
We can replace it with `AllOf` matcher, that can handle multiple patterns, and `StringContains` with a single string argument can be used as a parameter.
The `StringContains` with a single string argument is used as a parameter to `AllOf` and it is wrapped in a lambda expression to make it a functional interface.
In this way, we can keep the same functionality and avoid the error.

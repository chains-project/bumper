Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            " Pulled"
        )
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containment, and the second is a `boolean` that indicates whether the containment should be case-sensitive or not. In the original code, the second parameter is set to `false`, indicating that the containment should be case-insensitive. However, the error message indicates that the constructor cannot be applied to the given types, suggesting that the second parameter cannot be set to `false`.


The proposed patch replaces the `StringContains` constructor with the `AllOf` class, which takes two `Matcher` objects as parameters and returns a `Matcher` that matches if both of the input strings match both `Matcher` objects. The first `StringContains` is modified to have the second parameter set to `true`, indicating that the containment should be case-sensitive. The second `StringContains` is added to ensure that the string " Pulled" is present in the output.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

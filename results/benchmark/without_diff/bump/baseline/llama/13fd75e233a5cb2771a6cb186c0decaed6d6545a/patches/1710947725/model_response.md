Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        return new AllOf(
            new StringContains(
                false,
                String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
            ),
            new StringContains(
                true,
                " Pulled"
            )
        );
    }
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containing string, and the second is a `String` that represents the contained string. In this case, the error is caused by the fact that the second parameter is not a `String`, but a `String` literal.

To fix this, we can create a new `StringContains` object with the correct parameters, and then wrap it in an `AllOf` matcher, which takes two matchers as parameters and returns a matcher that matches if both of the given matchers match.

This patch changes the code to use the `AllOf` matcher, which allows us to combine multiple matchers into a single matcher, making the code more readable and maintainable.

It's worth noting that the `StringContains` matcher is not necessary, we can use `StringMatches` instead, it's more readable and it's the same as `StringContains` but with a more descriptive name.
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        return new AllOf(
            new StringMatches(
                false,
                String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
            ),
            new StringMatches(
                true,
                " Pulled"
            )
        );
    }
```
It's also worth mentioning that the `String.format` method is not necessary, we can replace it with a simple concatenation, it's more concise and easier to read.
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        return new AllOf(
            new StringMatches(
                false,
                "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image
            ),
            new StringMatches(
                true,
                " Pulled"
            )
        );
    }
```
It's important to note that this patch is just one possible solution, there are other ways to fix the error, but this one is the most straightforward and easy to understand.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Create a variable to hold the AlertDescription object
AlertDescription alertDescription = null;

// Check if the alertDescription object is not null
if (alertDescription != null) {
  // Call the method on the alertDescription object
  alertDescription.printStackTrace();
}
```
This patch creates a variable called `alertDescription` to hold the `AlertDescription` object, and then checks if it's not null before calling the `printStackTrace()` method on it.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `AlertDescription` object is not null, and that the `printStackTrace()` method is not being called on a null reference. If this is not the case, additional checks may be necessary to avoid a `NullPointerException`.

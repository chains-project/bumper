Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

// Replace the import statement with the following line
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```
The patch removes the dependence on the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package, which is no longer available, and replaces it with the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package, which contains the same `TlsFatalAlert` class.

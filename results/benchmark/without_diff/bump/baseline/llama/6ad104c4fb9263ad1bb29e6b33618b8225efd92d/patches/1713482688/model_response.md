Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// ...

AlertDescription alertDescription = new AlertDescription("BadRecord MAC");
```
Replace the import statement with the following:
```
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
And replace the creation of the AlertDescription object with the following:
```
AlertDescription alertDescription = new AlertDescription("BadRecord MAC", org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription.RESERVED);
```
This patch uses the RESERVED constant from the AlertDescription class to create a new AlertDescription object with the same effect as the original code.
The RESERVED constant is used to indicate that the alert is not included in the TLS specification and is reserved for future use.
By using this constant, the code can compile without depending on the missing package.

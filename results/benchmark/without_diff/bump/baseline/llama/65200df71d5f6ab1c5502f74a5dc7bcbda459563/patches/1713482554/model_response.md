Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setDependencyVersion(DependencyVersion.fromMap(globalConfig.getDependencyVersion())) // Add this line
            .build();
}
```
The `DependencyVersion` class is part of the `org.sonar.api.utils.Dependency Versions` class, which is not available in the provided code snippet. To fix the error, we need to add the `setDependencyVersion` method to the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` object. This method takes a `DependencyVersion` object as a parameter, which is created using the `DependencyVersion.fromMap` method. The `DependencyVersion` object is created from a map of dependency versions, which is obtained from the `globalConfig.getDependencyVersion()` method.

By adding this line of code, we ensure that the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` object is built with the correct dependency version, which should resolve the error.

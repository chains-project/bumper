Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setLanguageSubscriptions( LanguageSubscriptions.empty()) // Add this line
            .build();
}
```
The error message indicates that the `LanguageSubscriptions` class cannot be found. To fix this, we can add the `setLanguageSubscriptions` method to the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()` object. This method is available in the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` class, and it sets the language subscriptions for the analysis engine.

By adding this line, we are setting the language subscriptions to an empty list, which should resolve the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `LanguageSubscriptions` class is available in the codebase. If the `LanguageSubscriptions` class is not available, then this patch will not work, and a different solution will be needed.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setProjectBaseDir(globalConfig.getProjectBaseDir()) // Add this line
            .build();
}
```
The error message suggests that the `SonarLintEngine` class is unable to find the `ProjectBaseDir` field in the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` class. To fix this, we can add the `setProjectBaseDir` method call to the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method, which will set the `ProjectBaseDir` field in the resulting `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` object.

This patch addresses the error by adding the missing `setProjectBaseDir` method call to the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method. The `setProjectBaseDir` method is available in the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` class, so we can use it to set the `ProjectBaseDir` field in the resulting configuration object.

Note that we cannot remove the `Override` decorator because the `buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration` method is overriding a method from the `SonarLintEngine` class. We also cannot use removed library methods identified with `--`, but we can use added library methods identified with `++`. Therefore, we do not need to modify the method signature.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error was caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class was not visible to the client code. By creating a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport` within the `AppenderUtils` class, we make sure that the class is available at runtime.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing it will not cause any issues. If this is not the case, a more thorough analysis of the codebase would be necessary to determine the best course of action.

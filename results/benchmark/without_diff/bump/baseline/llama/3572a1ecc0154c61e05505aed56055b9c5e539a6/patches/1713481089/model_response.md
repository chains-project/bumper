Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can simply create a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport` and return it.

It's important to note that this fix assumes that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing it will not cause any issues. If the class is used elsewhere, a more comprehensive approach may be needed to address the issue.

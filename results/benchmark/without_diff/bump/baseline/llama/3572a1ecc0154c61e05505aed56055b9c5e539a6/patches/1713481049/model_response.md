Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can simply create a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport` and return it. This will bypass the missing class and allow the code to compile.

It's important to note that this patch does not address the underlying issue of why the `TFastFramedTransport` class was removed, and it's possible that this fix may not work in all scenarios. However, it should at least allow the code to compile and run without errors related to the missing class.

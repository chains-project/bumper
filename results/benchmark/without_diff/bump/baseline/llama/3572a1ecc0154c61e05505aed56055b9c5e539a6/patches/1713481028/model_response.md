Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The patch removes the error by providing a concrete implementation of `TFastFramedTransport` that can be used in the client code. The `getTFastFramedTransport()` method returns an instance of `TFastFramedTransport`, which can be used to replace the failing import statement.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing the import statement will not cause any issues. If this is not the case, a more comprehensive solution may be required.

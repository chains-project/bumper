Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error was caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class was not visible to the client code. By creating a static method `getTFastFramedTransport()` that returns a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport()`, we are making the class visible to the client code and the error is resolved.

It's worth noting that this patch assumes that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is not being used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing the import statement will not cause any issues. If this is not the case, a more thorough analysis of the code would be necessary to determine the best course of action.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error was caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class was not available in the dependency version used by the client code. To fix this, we simply created a static method that returns a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport`, which can be used instead of the import statement.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that it's safe to remove the import statement. If this is not the case, a more thorough analysis of the code would be necessary to determine the best course of action.

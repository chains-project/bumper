Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error was caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class was not available in the dependencies used by the project. To fix this, we simply created a new instance of the `TFastFramedTransport` class and returned it. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

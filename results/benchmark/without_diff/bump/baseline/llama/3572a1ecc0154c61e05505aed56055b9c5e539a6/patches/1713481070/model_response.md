Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static method `getTFastFramedTransport()` that returns a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport`. This allows the client code to use the `TFastFramedTransport` class without any changes.

The error in the original code was caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class was not available in the classpath. By creating a static method that returns a new instance of this class, we ensure that the class is available when the client code is compiled and run.

Note that this patch does not modify the signature of the `AppenderUtils` class or any of its methods, so it should not affect the behavior of the code. However, it does introduce a new static method that can be used to obtain an instance of `TFastFramedTransport`.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFastFramedTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TFastFramedTransport getTFastFramedTransport() {
        return new TFastFramedTransport();
    }
}
```

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can simply create a new instance of `TFastFramedTransport` and return it. This will bypass the dependency on the removed class.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(false, "Image pulled successfully")
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containing string, and the second is a `String` that represents the contained string. In the original code, the second parameter is a formatted string that includes the image name.

The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types, which means that the types of the parameters don't match. It's likely that the `StringContains` class has been updated to require different types for its parameters.

The patch creates a new `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers. The first `StringContains` matcher looks for the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for " followed by the image name. The second `StringContains` matcher looks for the string "Image pulled successfully". The `AllOf` matcher returns true if both of its component matchers return true.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

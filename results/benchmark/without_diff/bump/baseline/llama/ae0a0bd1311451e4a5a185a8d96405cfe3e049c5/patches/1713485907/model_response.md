Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(false, "pulling image")
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containing string, and the second is a `String` that represents the contained string. In the original code, the second parameter is a format string that includes the image name. To fix the error, we can use the `String.format` method to format the contained string with the image name, like this:
```scss
new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for %s")
```
However, this will not work because the `StringContains` constructor expects a `String` object, not a format string. To fix this, we can use the `String.format` method to format the contained string with the image name, like this:
```scss
new StringContains(false, String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image))
```
This will format the contained string with the image name, which will fix the error.

We also need to remove the `Override` annotation, because the `StringContains` class does not have an `Override` method.

The resulting code will look like this:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(false, "pulling image")
    );
}
```
This code should now compile and run without errors.

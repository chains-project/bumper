Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            "pullImage"
        )
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters: the first is a `String` that represents the containment, and the second is a `boolean` that indicates whether the containment is case-sensitive or not. In this case, the second parameter is not provided, so it defaults to `false`.

The error message indicates that the constructor `StringContains` cannot be applied to the given types, which means that the types of the parameters passed to the constructor do not match the expected types.


The patch creates a new `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers. The first `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for " followed by the image name, and the second `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string "pullImage". The `AllOf` matcher returns a matcher that matches if both of its component matchers match.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final variable `Tv` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without explicitly importing it, as the import statement is not necessary when the class is used within the same package.

The patch also removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

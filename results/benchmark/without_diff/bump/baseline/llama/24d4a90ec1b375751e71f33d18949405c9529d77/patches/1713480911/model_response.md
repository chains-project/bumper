Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final variable `Tv` of type `Tv` and assigns it a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without any issues.

The `Tv` class is not imported in the original code, and the error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found. By creating a static final variable `Tv`, we ensure that the `Tv` class is available throughout the class, and the error is resolved.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.getInstance();

    public void testSomething() {
        TV.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` that initialized `Tv.getInstance()` and uses it instead of `Tv` in the `testSomething()` method.

The error was caused by the fact that `Tv` is not a static class, so it cannot be imported. By creating a static final field that initializes `Tv.getInstance()`, we ensure that `Tv` is initialized only once, and we can use it safely in the code.

Note that the `Tv` class is not modified, and the patch only changes the client code.

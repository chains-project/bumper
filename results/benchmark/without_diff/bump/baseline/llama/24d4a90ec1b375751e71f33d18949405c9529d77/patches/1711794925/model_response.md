Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = Tv.getInstance();

    @org.junit.Test
    public void test() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initializes it with `Tv.getInstance()`. This allows the code to use `Tv` without any issues.

Please note that this patch only addresses the reported error and does not guarantee that the code will compile or run correctly. It is essential to test the code thoroughly after applying the patch.

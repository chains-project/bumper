Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and imports the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This allows the code to compile without the error message.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is still available in the updated dependency version. If the `Tv` class has been removed, you may need to use a different approach to fix the error.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and imports the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without any issues.

Note that the `Tv` class is part of the Jcabi library, which is not included in the standard Java Development Kit (JDK). Therefore, you'll need to add the Jcabi library to your project's dependencies in order to use it.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ),
        new StringContains(
            true,
            "pullImage"
        )
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters, a `boolean` value indicating whether the string should be included in the match or not, and the string pattern to match. In this case, the second `StringContains` constructor call has the `true` value for the first parameter, which means that the string pattern should be included in the match. However, the pattern itself is an empty string, which will never match any string.

The patch creates a new `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers. The first `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for" followed by the image name. The second `StringContains` matcher checks for the presence of the string "pullImage". The `AllOf` matcher will only match if both of its component matchers match, so this should fix the error.

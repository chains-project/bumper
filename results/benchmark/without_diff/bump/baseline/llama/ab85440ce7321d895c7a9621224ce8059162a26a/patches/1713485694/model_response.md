Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringContains(true, "imagePulled")
    );
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `StringContains` constructor cannot be applied to the given types. This is because `StringContains` expects a single string argument representing the expected substring, whereas the code passes a format string with multiple placeholders.


To fix this, we can use the `AllOf` class from the same package as `StringContains` to combine multiple matchers. We create a new `StringContains` matcher with the format string and the image name as arguments, and then wrap it in an `AllOf` matcher along with a new `StringContains` matcher that checks for the presence of the word "imagePulled". This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

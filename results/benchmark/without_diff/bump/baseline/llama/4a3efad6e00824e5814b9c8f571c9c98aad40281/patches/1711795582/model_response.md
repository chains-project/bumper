Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    // Create a variable for the certification permission
    private CertificationPermission certificationPermission;

    public Signer(CertificationPermission certificationPermission) {
        this.certificationPermission = certificationPermission;
    }

    public void sign() {
        // Use the certification permission to sign the document
        certificationPermission.sign();
    }
}
```
The patch creates a variable for the `CertificationPermission` object and passes it as a parameter to the constructor. This allows the `sign()` method to use the `CertificationPermission` object to sign the document.

With this patch, the error message about not being able to find the `CertificationPermission` class should be resolved.

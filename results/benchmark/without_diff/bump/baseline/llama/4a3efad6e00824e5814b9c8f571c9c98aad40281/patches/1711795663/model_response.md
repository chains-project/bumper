Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final String Pades_Certification_Permission = "eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // ...
            CertificationPermission certificationPermission = (CertificationPermission) Class.forName(Pades_Certification_Permission).newInstance();
            // ...
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
The error message indicates that the class `CertificationPermission` cannot be found. We can import the class and use it directly in the code. We also added a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur when instantiating the class.

It is important to note that the patch provided above may not be the only solution to the error. The error could be caused by other dependencies or conflicts in the project. Therefore, it is recommended to test the patch and ensure it resolves the issue before applying it to the code.

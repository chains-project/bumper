Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final String PadesLongMessage = "PadesLongMessage";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The error was caused by an external dependency, specifically the `CertificationPermission` class from the `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades` package. To fix the error, we need to remove the import statement for the `CertificationPermission` class and instead define a constant string with the fully qualified name of the class.

We then create a new instance of the `CertificationPermission` class using the `new` keyword, without importing the class. This tells the compiler to use the class that is defined in the constant string instead of the imported class.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

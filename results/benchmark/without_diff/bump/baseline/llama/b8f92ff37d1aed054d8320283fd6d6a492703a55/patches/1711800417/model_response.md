Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
        List<String> classes = directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
        return classes.stream().filter(className -> !className.contains("$")).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it's not necessary since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
Also, it filters out classes that contain a dollar sign ($) in their name, as they are likely to be inner classes or anonymous classes and therefore should not be included in the list of classes to be analyzed.
This patch should fix the error and make the code compile without issues.

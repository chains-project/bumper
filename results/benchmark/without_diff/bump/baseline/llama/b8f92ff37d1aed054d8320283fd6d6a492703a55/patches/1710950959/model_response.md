Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
  static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
        List<String> classes = directoryScanner.scan();
        return classes.stream().filter(className -> !className.contains("$")).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
```
The proposed patch uses the `filter()` method to filter out classes that contain a dollar sign (`$`) in their name. This is because the `DirectoryScanner` class is returning classes that are not top-level classes, but inner classes that have a dollar sign in their name. By filtering these classes out, the code should no longer throw a `CannotFindSymbol` error.

Additionally, the `collect()` method is used to collect the filtered list of class names into a list.

This patch does not change the signature of the method, and it does not remove any overridden methods. It only modifies the code to fix the error by filtering out the inner classes that are not top-level classes.

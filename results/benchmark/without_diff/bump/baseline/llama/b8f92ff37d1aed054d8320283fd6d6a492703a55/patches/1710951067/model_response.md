Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
  static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
        List<String> classes = directoryScanner.scan();
        classes.stream().filter(className -> !className.contains("$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$")).collect(Collectors.toList());
        return classes;
    }
```
The error is caused by a conflict between the version of the spring-core library used by the project and the version of the spoon-lib library that is being used. The `DirectoryScanner` class from the spoon-lib library is using a method from the `TestListResolver` class that is not available in the version of spring-core being used by the project.

The proposed patch filters out the classes that contain the "$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$" string, which are the classes that are generated by the Spring CGLIB enhancement. This should prevent the error from occurring.

It's important to note that this is a temporary solution, and the root cause of the conflict should be addressed by updating the version of the spring-core library used by the project to a version that is compatible with the version of the spoon-lib library being used.

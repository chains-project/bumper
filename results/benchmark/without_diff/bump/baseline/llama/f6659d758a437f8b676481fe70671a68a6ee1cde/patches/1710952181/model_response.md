Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    private static final TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();

    public void testMethod() {
        trustedTagInspector.checkTag("foo", "bar");
    }
}
```
The issue is caused by the missing `TrustedTagInspector` class, which is part of the `snakeyaml` library. The library has been updated, and the `TrustedTagInspector` class is no longer available.

To fix the issue, we can create a new instance of the `TrustedTagInspector` class and use it to call the `checkTag` method.

Here's the patched code:
```
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    private static final TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();

    public void testMethod() {
        trustedTagInspector.checkTag("foo", "bar");
    }
}
```
This patch creates a new instance of the `TrustedTagInspector` class and assigns it to a static field. Then, in the `testMethod` method, we call the `checkTag` method on the instance.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    for (String packageToScan : packages) {
        String regex = String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan);
        if (new FilterBuilder().include(regex).apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. Additionally, it removes the `filterBuilder` variable, as it is not used anywhere in the method. The method signature remains the same, but the code is easier to read without the unused variable.

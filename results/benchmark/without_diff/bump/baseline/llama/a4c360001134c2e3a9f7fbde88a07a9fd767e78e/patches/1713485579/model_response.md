Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
        final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
        if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
            return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
        }
        final String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
        for (String packageToScan : packages) {
            String regex = String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan);
            if (new FilterBuilder().include(regex).apply(s)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it's not necessary and can be safely removed. The method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Additionally, the patch uses the `String.format` method to create the regex pattern for the package name, instead of concatenating strings. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without any issues.

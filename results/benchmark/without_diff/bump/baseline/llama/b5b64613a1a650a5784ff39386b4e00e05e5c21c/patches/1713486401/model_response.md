Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private void checkInputs(JFrogPlatformInstance server) throws IOException {
    if (isAllBlank(server.getUrl(), server.getArtifactory().getUrl(), server.getDistribution().getUrl(),
            step.url, step.artifactoryUrl, step.distributionUrl)) {
        throw new IOException("Server URL is missing");
    }
    if (isNotBlank(step.credentialsId)) {
        if (isNotBlank(step.username)) {
            throw new IOException("'rtServer' step can't include both credentialsId and username");
        }
        if (isNotBlank(step.password)) {
            throw new IOException("'rtServer' step can't include both credentialsId and password");
        }
    }
}

boolean isAllBlank(String... strings) {
    for (String string : strings) {
        if (string != null && !string.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

boolean isNotBlank(String string) {
    return string != null && !string.isEmpty();
}
```
The patch introduces two new methods, `isAllBlank` and `isNotBlank`, which are used to simplify the conditionals in the `checkInputs` method. The `isAllBlank` method takes an array of strings and returns `true` if all the strings are blank, and `false` otherwise. The `isNotBlank` method takes a single string and returns `true` if the string is not blank, and `false` otherwise.

With these two methods, the `checkInputs` method becomes simpler and easier to read. The patch also removes the `Override` decorator, as it is not needed.

Note that the patch does not modify the method signature, and it only adds two new methods that are used within the `checkInputs` method. The patch also does not use any removed library methods, and it only uses added library methods.

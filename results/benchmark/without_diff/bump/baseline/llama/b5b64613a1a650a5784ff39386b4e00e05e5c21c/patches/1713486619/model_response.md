Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
public void execute() throws Exception {
        if (server == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifactory server must be configured");
        }
        if (StringUtils.isAllBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) || StringUtils.isNoneBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Exactly one of 'kanikoImageFile' or 'jibImageFile' must be configured");
        }
        CommonDeployer deployer = new CommonDeployer();
        deployer.setServer(server);
        deployer.setRepo(sourceRepo);
        FilePath tempDir = ExtractorUtils.createAndGetTempDir(ws);
        EnvExtractor envExtractor = new CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env, kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile);
        super.execute("Create Docker Build", "org.jfrog.build.extractor.docker.extractor.BuildDockerCreator", envExtractor, tempDir);
    }
```
The patch proposes renaming the `CreateDockerBuildExecutor` class to `BuildDockerCreator` to match the fully qualified name of the class mentioned in the error message. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

It's important to note that this patch only addresses the reported error and doesn't consider any potential issues with the rest of the code.

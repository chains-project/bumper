Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
public void execute() throws Exception {
        if (server == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifactory server must be configured");
        }
        if (StringUtils.isAllBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) || StringUtils.isNoneBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Exactly one of 'kanikoImageFile' or 'jibImageFile' must be configured");
        }
        CommonDeployer deployer = new CommonDeployer();
        deployer.setServer(server);
        deployer.setRepo(sourceRepo);
        FilePath tempDir = ExtractorUtils.createAndGetTempDir(ws);
        EnvExtractor envExtractor = new CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env, kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) {
            @Override
            public void extract() throws Exception {
                super.extract();
                // Add the following line to fix the error
                BuildDockerCreator.dockerImage = BuildDockerCreator.getDockerImage(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile);
            }
        };
        super.execute("Create Docker Build", "org.jfrog.build.extractor.docker.extractor.BuildDockerCreator", envExtractor, tempDir);
    }
```
The patch creates a new instance of `CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor` and overrides the `extract` method. Inside the `extract` method, we call the `super.extract()` method to ensure that the parent class's `extract` method is called, and then we set the `BuildDockerCreator.dockerImage` field to the result of `BuildDockerCreator.getDockerImage(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)`.


This patch fixes the error by providing a value for the `dockerImage` field, which is used in the `BuildDockerCreator` class to create the Docker image. The `getDockerImage` method is added to the `BuildDockerCreator` class to retrieve the Docker image name based on the `kanikoImageFile` and `jibImageFile` parameters.


Note that this patch assumes that the `BuildDockerCreator` class is available in the codebase, and that the `getDockerImage` method can be added to that class without any issues. If there are any conflicts or issues with the proposed patch, you may need to modify the patch or provide additional information about the codebase to help resolve the issue.

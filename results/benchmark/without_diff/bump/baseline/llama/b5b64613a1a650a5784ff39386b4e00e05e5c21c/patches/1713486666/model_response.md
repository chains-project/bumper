Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
public void execute() throws Exception {
        if (server == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifactory server must be configured");
        }
        if (StringUtils.isAllBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) || StringUtils.isNoneBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Exactly one of 'kanikoImageFile' or 'jibImageFile' must be configured");
        }
        CommonDeployer deployer = new CommonDeployer();
        deployer.setServer(server);
        deployer.setRepo(sourceRepo);
        FilePath tempDir = ExtractorUtils.createAndGetTempDir(ws);
        EnvExtractor envExtractor = new CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env, kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) {
            @Override
            public void extract() throws Exception {
                super.extract();
                // Add the following line to fix the error
                BuildDockerCreator buildDockerCreator = new BuildDockerCreator(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env);
            }
        };
        super.execute("Create Docker Build", "org.jfrog.build.extractor.docker.extractor.BuildDockerCreator", envExtractor, tempDir);
    }
```
The proposed patch creates a new instance of `BuildDockerCreator` and calls its constructor with the required parameters. This fixes the error by providing a concrete implementation of the `BuildDockerCreator` interface, which is required by the `super.execute()` method.

The patch also adds a new `extract()` method to the `CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor` class, which calls the `super.extract()` method and then creates the `BuildDockerCreator` instance. This ensures that the `BuildDockerCreator` instance is created only once, and the `extract()` method can still be overridden in subclasses.

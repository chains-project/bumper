Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
public void execute() throws Exception {
        if (server == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifactory server must be configured");
        }
        if (StringUtils.isAllBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) || StringUtils.isNoneBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Exactly one of 'kanikoImageFile' or 'jibImageFile' must be configured");
        }
        CommonDeployer deployer = new CommonDeployer();
        deployer.setServer(server);
        deployer.setRepo(sourceRepo);
        FilePath tempDir = ExtractorUtils.createAndGetTempDir(ws);
        EnvExtractor envExtractor = new CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env, kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) {
            @Override
            public void extract() throws Exception {
                super.extract();
                // Add the following line to fix the error
                BuildDockerCreator buildDockerCreator = new BuildDockerCreator(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env);
            }
        };
        super.execute("Create Docker Build", "org.jfrog.build.extractor.docker.extractor.BuildDockerCreator", envExtractor, tempDir);
    }
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `BuildDockerCreator` class was not visible to the `CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor` class. By creating a new instance of `BuildDockerCreator` within the `extract` method of `CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor`, we ensure that the class is visible and the error is resolved.

Note that the `BuildDockerCreator` class is not marked as `Optional` or `Hidden`, so it is visible to the `CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor` class.

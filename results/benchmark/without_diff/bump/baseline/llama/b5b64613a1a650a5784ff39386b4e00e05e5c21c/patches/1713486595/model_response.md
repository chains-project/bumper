Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided code:
```java
public void execute() throws Exception {
        if (server == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Artifactory server must be configured");
        }
        if (StringUtils.isAllBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) || StringUtils.isNoneBlank(kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Exactly one of 'kanikoImageFile' or 'jibImageFile' must be configured");
        }
        CommonDeployer deployer = new CommonDeployer();
        deployer.setServer(server);
        deployer.setRepo(sourceRepo);
        FilePath tempDir = ExtractorUtils.createAndGetTempDir(ws);
        EnvExtractor envExtractor = new CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor(build, buildInfo, deployer, listener, launcher, tempDir, env, kanikoImageFile, jibImageFile) {
            @Override
            public void extract() throws Exception {
                super.extract();
                // Add your custom code here
            }
        };
        super.execute("Create Docker Build", "org.jfrog.build.extractor.docker.extractor.BuildDockerCreator", envExtractor, tempDir);
    }
```
The proposed patch creates a new anonymous class that extends `CreateDockerBuildEnvExtractor` and overrides the `extract()` method. The `super.extract()` call is made to ensure that the original extractor's logic is executed, and then you can add custom code to handle the dependency issue.


Note that the patch does not modify the method signature, and it only adds a new anonymous class that extends the original extractor. The `envExtractor` variable is assigned the new class, which will be used when calling `super.execute()`.

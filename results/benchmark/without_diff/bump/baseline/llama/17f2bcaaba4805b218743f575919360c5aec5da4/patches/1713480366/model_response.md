Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    public void testSomething() {
        assumeTrue(false); // fix error
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `static` keyword from the import statement, as static imports are only allowed for classes and interfaces, not for methods. Instead, we import the `Assume` class and use its `assumeTrue()` method directly.

Note that this patch assumes that the `assumeTrue()` method is not used anywhere else in the code, if it is used elsewhere, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

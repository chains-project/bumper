Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.junit.Assume;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        assumeTrue(true);
    }
}
```

The patch removes the static import of the `assumeTrue` method, which is not allowed in Java 8. Instead, we import the `Assume` class statically and call the `assumeTrue` method directly.
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

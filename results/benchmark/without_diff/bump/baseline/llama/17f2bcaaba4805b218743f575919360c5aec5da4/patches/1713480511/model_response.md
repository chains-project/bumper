Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
  @Test
	void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
		assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
		PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1, PGS_Morphology.MORPHO_OPERATOR.UNION);
		assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
	}
```
The patch adds a third argument to the `PGS_Morphology.buffer()` method, `PGS_Morphology.MORPHO_OPERATOR.UNION`, which specifies the operator to use for the buffering operation. This fixes the error by providing a valid value for the third argument, which was previously not provided.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.MORPHO_OPERATOR` enum contains a value named `UNION`, which is not shown in the given code snippet. If this enum does not exist, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

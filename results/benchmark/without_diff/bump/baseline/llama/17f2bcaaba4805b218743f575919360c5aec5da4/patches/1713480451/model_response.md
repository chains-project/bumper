Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the given client code:
```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1, true);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The patch adds a third argument `true` to the `buffer` method, which is the fix for the error. The third argument is used to specify whether the resulting shape should be simplified, which was not specified in the original code.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can simply remove the import statement and the reference to the `TFramedTransport` class in the code. Instead, we can use the `TTransport` class from the same library, which is still available.

Here's the modified code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
With this change, the code should now compile without any errors related to the `TFramedTransport` class.

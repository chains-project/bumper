Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library in version 0.12.0. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with the following:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
```
and modify the constructor to create a new instance of `TTransport` instead of `TFramedTransport`:
```java
public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
    this.framedTransport = transport;
}
```
With these changes, the code should now compile without errors.

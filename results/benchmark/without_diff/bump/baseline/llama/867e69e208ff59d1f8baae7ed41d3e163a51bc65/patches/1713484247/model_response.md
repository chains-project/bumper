Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport.TFramedInputTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader() {
        this.framedTransport = new TFramedTransport.TFramedInputTransport();
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the latest version of the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we've imported the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, and created a new instance of the `TFramedInputTransport` class in the constructor.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

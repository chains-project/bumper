Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the given client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class SimpleThriftLogger {
    private final TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public SimpleThriftLogger(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        framedTransport.write(message);
    }
}
```
The error in the given code is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with an import statement for the `TTransport` class, which is the superclass of `TFramedTransport`. We can also remove the `TFramedTransport` constructor argument, as it is no longer needed.

Here's the patched code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class SimpleThriftLogger {
    private final TTransport transport;

    public SimpleThriftLogger(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        transport.write(message);
    }
}
```
This patch removes the dependency on the removed `TFramedTransport` class and replaces it with the still existing `TTransport` class.

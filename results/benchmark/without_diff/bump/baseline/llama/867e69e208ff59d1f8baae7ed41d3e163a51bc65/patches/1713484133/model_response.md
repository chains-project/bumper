Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class SimpleThriftLogger {
    private final TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public SimpleThriftLogger(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        framedTransport.write(message);
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` decorator, as it is not necessary, and adds a constructor that takes a `TFramedTransport` instance as a parameter. The `framedTransport` field is assigned in the constructor, and the `log` method uses it to write the message.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport.Factory transportFactory;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport.Factory transportFactory) {
        this.transportFactory = transportFactory;
    }

    public void read() {
        TFramedTransport transport = transportFactory.getTransport();
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a constructor for the `ThriftReader` class that takes a `TFramedTransport.Factory` object as a parameter. The `TFramedTransport.Factory` interface provides a way to create instances of `TFramedTransport`, which is required to fix the error.

The patch also removes the `Override` annotation from the `read()` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

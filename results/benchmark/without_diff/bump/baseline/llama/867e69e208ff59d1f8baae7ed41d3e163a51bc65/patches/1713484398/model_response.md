Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error was caused by an external dependency, specifically the `TFramedTransport` class, which is part of the Apache Thrift library. The proposed patch creates a constructor that takes a `TFramedTransport` object as a parameter, which can be used to inject a mock or stub implementation of the `TFramedTransport` class for testing purposes. This allows the `ThriftReader` class to be tested independently of the external dependency.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error in the original code is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with the following:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
```
We can also remove the `TFramedTransport` constructor argument, as it is no longer needed. The `TTransport` class provides the same methods as `TFramedTransport`, so we can use it directly.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
This patch removes the dependency on the removed `TFramedTransport` class and replaces it with the still-existing `TTransport` class.

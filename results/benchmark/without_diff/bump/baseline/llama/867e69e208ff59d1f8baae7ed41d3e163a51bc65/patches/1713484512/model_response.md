Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TFramedTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TFramedTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The error is caused by the fact that the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed from the Apache Thrift library. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with the following:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
```
We can also remove the `TFramedTransport` constructor argument, as it is no longer needed. The resulting code will look like this:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport framedTransport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport framedTransport) {
        this.framedTransport = framedTransport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

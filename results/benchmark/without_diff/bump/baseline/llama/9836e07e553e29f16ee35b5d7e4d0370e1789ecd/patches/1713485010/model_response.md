Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image),
        new StringEndsWith(image)
    );
}
```
The `StringContains` constructor takes two parameters, the first is a `String` that is the expected substring, and the second is a `boolean` indicating whether the substring should be matched case-insensitively. In this case, the second parameter is not provided, so it defaults to `false`.

The error message indicates that the constructor `StringContains` cannot be applied to the given types, which means that the second parameter should be added.


In the proposed patch, we replace `StringContains` with `AllOf`, which takes two or more matchers as arguments and returns a matcher that matches if all of the provided matchers match. We then add two matchers to `AllOf`: `StringContains` with the first parameter being the substring "Status: Downloaded newer image for " and the second parameter being the image variable, and `StringEndsWith` with the image variable as its parameter.

This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new AllOf(
        new StringContains(false, "Status: Downloaded newer image for "), 
        new StringContains(image)
    );
}
```
This patch creates a new `AllOf` matcher that combines two `StringContains` matchers. The first `StringContains` matcher looks for the string "Status: Downloaded newer image for " followed by the image name, while the second `StringContains` matcher looks for the image name. By combining these two matchers, the `imagePulled` method can still return a `Matcher<String>` that matches the expected output.


The `AllOf` matcher is a class from the Hamcrest library that allows combining multiple matchers. It takes an array of matchers and returns a matcher that matches if all of the elements in the array match. In this case, we create an array with two elements: the two `StringContains` matchers.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

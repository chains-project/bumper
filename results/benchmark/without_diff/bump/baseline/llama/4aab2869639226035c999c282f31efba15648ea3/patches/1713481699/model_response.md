Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final Storages storages;

    public YamlPolicyFactory(Storages storages) {
        this.storages = storages;
    }

    public Policy loadPolicy(String policyFile) {
        try {
            // Use the AstO factory to load the policy from the YAML file
            return AstO.parse(policyFile, storages.get(policyFile));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. The `AstO` factory is used to load the policy from the YAML file, which is a new library method added in the updated version of the dependency. The `storages` field is injected through the constructor, allowing the `YamlPolicyFactory` to use the `Storages` instance to retrieve the necessary storage for the policy file.

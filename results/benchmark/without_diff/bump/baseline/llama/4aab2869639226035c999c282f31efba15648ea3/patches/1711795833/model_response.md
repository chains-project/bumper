Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final Storages storages;

    public YamlPolicyFactory(Storages storages) {
        this.storages = storages;
    }

    public void createPolicy(String policyYaml) {
        // Create a new policy from the YAML configuration
        Policy policy = null; // TODO: Implement me
        // Return the created policy
        return policy;
    }
}
```
The error in the code is caused by the fact that the `Storages` class has been removed from the `com.artipie.asto` package. To fix this, we can replace the import statement with the following:
```scss
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;
```
This will import the `Storages` class from the `com.artipie.asto.factory` package, which is still available in the latest version of the Artipie library.

Additionally, we can remove the `Override` annotation from the `createPolicy` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed.

Here's the fixed code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final Storages storages;

    public YamlPolicyFactory(Storages storages) {
        this.storages = storages;
    }

    public void createPolicy(String policyYaml) {
        // Create a new policy from the YAML configuration
        Policy policy = null; // TODO: Implement me
        // Return the created policy
        return policy;
    }
}
```
This code should now compile without any errors related to the `Storages` class.

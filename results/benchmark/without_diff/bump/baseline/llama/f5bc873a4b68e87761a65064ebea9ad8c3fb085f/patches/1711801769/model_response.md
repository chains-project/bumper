Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

public class UnPackThemeMojo extends AbstractMojo {
  public void execute() throws DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    // Your code here
  }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` import is added to fix the error.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private JsonBranch jsonBranch;

    public MarcFactory(JsonBranch jsonBranch) {
        this.jsonBranch = jsonBranch;
    }

    public MarcFactory() {
        this(new JsonBranch());
    }

    public JsonBranch getJsonBranch() {
        return jsonBranch;
    }
}
```
The patch creates a constructor that takes a `JsonBranch` object as a parameter and sets it as the `jsonBranch` field. It also creates a default constructor that creates a new `JsonBranch` object if none is provided. This allows the code to compile without any errors.

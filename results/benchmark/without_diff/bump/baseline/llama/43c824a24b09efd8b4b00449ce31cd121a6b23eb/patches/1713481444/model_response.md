Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private JsonBranch jsonBranch;

    public MarcFactory(JsonBranch jsonBranch) {
        this.jsonBranch = jsonBranch;
    }

    public MarcFactory() {
        this(new JsonBranch());
    }

    public Marc createMarc() {
        return new Marc(jsonBranch);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a constructor for the `MarcFactory` class that takes a `JsonBranch` object as a parameter. It also creates a new `JsonBranch` object if none is provided. This ensures that the `jsonBranch` field is always initialized with a valid `JsonBranch` object, avoiding the `NullPointerException` that causes the error.

The patch also removes the `@Override` annotation from the `createMarc()` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed.

This patch can be applied to the failing client code to fix the error and make the code compile-time error free.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();

    public static JsonBranch getJsonBranch() {
        return jsonBranch;
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static instance of `JsonBranch` and returns it as a static method. This allows the client code to use the `MarcFactory.getJsonBranch()` method to get the instance of `JsonBranch` without creating a new instance every time.

The patch also removes the `Override` decorator, as the `getJsonBranch()` method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class is still available in the updated dependency version. If the `JsonBranch` class is removed, a different patch would be required.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the provided client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch JSON_BRANCH = new JsonBranch();

    public static JsonBranch getJsonBranch() {
        return JSON_BRANCH;
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final variable `JSON_BRANCH` of type `JsonBranch` and assigns it a new instance of `JsonBranch()`. The `getJsonBranch()` method is then modified to return this static variable.

This patch fixes the error by providing a valid instance of `JsonBranch` that can be used by the client code.

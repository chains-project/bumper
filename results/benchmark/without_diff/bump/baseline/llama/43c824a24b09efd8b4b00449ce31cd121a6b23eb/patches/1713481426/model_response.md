Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();

    public static JsonBranch getJsonBranch() {
        return jsonBranch;
    }
}
```
The patch creates a private static final variable `jsonBranch` of type `JsonBranch` and initialize it with a new instance of `JsonBranch()`. The `getJsonBranch()` method now returns this variable, which should fix the error.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class is still available and has the same constructor as before. If the `JsonBranch` class has changed, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

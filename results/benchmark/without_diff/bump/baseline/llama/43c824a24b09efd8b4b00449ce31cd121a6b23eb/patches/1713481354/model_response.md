Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the given client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch jsonBranch;

    static {
        jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();
    }

    public static JsonBranch getJsonBranch() {
        return jsonBranch;
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static variable `jsonBranch` and assigns it a new instance of `JsonBranch()` in the static block. The `getJsonBranch()` method returns this static variable, allowing the client code to use the same instance throughout the application.

This patch addresses the "cannot find symbol" error by ensuring that the `JsonBranch` class is available to the client code. By creating a static instance of `JsonBranch`, we avoid the need to create a new instance every time the client code needs to use it.

Note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class is part of the project's dependencies and is available in the classpath. If the `JsonBranch` class is not available in the project's dependencies, you may need to add the necessary dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file (if using Maven) or `build.gradle` file (if using Gradle).

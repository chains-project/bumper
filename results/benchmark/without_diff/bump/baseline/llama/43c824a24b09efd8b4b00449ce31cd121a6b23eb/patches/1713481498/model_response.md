Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch JSON_BRANCH = new JsonBranch();

    public static Marc createMarc() {
        JsonObject json = JSON_BRANCH.getObject();
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch replaces the import statement `import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;` with `import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;` to fix the error. The `JsonBranch` class has been removed from the dependency update, so we need to use the fully qualified name to import it.

Additionally, we've added a field `JSON_BRANCH` to the `MarcFactory` class to store the instance of `JsonBranch`. This allows us to use the `JsonBranch` instance instead of creating a new one every time the `createMarc()` method is called. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, but it makes it easier to read and maintain.

With this patch, the error should be resolved, and the code should compile without any issues.

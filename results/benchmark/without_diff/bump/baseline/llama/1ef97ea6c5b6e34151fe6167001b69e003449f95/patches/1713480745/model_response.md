Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(Date.from(Instant.ofEpochMilli(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant()));
}
```
This patch uses the `Date.from()` method to create a `Date` object from the `Instant` object returned by `super.between(from, to).getTime()`, and then creates a `Timestamp` object from the `Date` object using the constructor that takes a `Date` object.

This should fix the incompatible types error, as the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `Date` object is able to handle the `Instant` object returned by `super.between(from, to).getTime()`.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Date sqlDate = new java.sql.Date(super.between(from, to).getTime());
    return new Timestamp(sqlDate.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a `java.sql.Date` object from the result of `super.between(from, to)` using the `java.sql.Date` constructor that takes a `long` parameter, which is the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). Then, it creates a `Timestamp` object from the `java.sql.Date` object using the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `long` parameter.

This patch should fix the error because it converts the `java.util.Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a `java.sql.Date` object, which can be used to create a `Timestamp` object.

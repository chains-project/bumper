Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.util.Date utilDate = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(utilDate.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a new `java.util.Date` object from the result of `super.between(from, to)`, which is a `java.util.Date`, and then creates a `Timestamp` object from that `java.util.Date` object using the `new Timestamp(long)` constructor.

This patch should fix the incompatible types error because it avoids the conversion of `java.util.Date` to `java.sql.Timestamp`, which is not allowed. Instead, it creates a new `java.sql.Timestamp` object from the `java.util.Date` object using the appropriate constructor.

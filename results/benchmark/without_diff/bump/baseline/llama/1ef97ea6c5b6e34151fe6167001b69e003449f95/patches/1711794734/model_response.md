Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.util.Date utilDate = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(utilDate.getTime());
}
```
The patch removes the incompatible types error by casting the result of `super.between(from, to)` to `java.util.Date` before creating a new `Timestamp` object.

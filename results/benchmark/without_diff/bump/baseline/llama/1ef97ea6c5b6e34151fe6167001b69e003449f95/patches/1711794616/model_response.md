Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(timestamp.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a local variable `timestamp` of type `java.sql.Timestamp` and assigns it the result of `super.between(from, to)`. Then, it creates a new `Timestamp` object using the `getTime()` method of `timestamp`.

This patch should fix the error because it correctly converts the `java.util.Date` returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which is what the method's signature expects.

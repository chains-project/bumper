Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.util.Date utilDate = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(utilDate.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a `java.util.Date` object from the result of `super.between(from, to)`, which is a `java.util.Date`, and then creates a `Timestamp` object from that `java.util.Date` object using the `Timestamp(long)` constructor.

This patch should fix the error because it avoids the incompatible types issue by converting the `java.util.Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a `long` value using the `getTime()` method, which can be passed to the `Timestamp(long)` constructor.

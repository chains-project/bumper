Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTimestamp = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(sqlTimestamp.getTime());
}
```
The patch creates a Java SQL Timestamp object from the result of the super method, and then creates a new Timestamp object from that SQL Timestamp object. This should fix the type incompatibility issue.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `between` method is defined in a class that extends another class that has a `between` method. If that's not the case, additional changes might be needed.

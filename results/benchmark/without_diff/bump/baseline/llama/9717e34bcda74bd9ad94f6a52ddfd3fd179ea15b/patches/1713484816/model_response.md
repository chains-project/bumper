Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(MkGithub.class);
        T.add(MkGithub.class.getMethod("mockGithub", String.class, String.class));
        T.add(MkGithub.class.getMethod("mockGithub", String.class, String.class));
    }

    public static void mockGithub(String owner, String name) {
        // TO-DO: implement your code here
    }
}
```
The patch adds the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, which is a utility class for aspect-oriented programming. The `Tv` class is used to register methods that should be intercepted by aspects. In this case, we add the `MkGithub` class and its `mockGithub` method to the `Tv` instance, which enables aspect-oriented programming for the `MkGithub` class.

The patch also adds the `mockGithub` method to the `MkGithub` class, which is the method that is failing in the original code. The `mockGithub` method is not implemented in the patch, as it is up to the developer to implement the code that should be executed when the aspect is triggered.

By using aspect-oriented programming, the patch allows the developer to decouple the cross-cutting concern of logging from the business logic of the `MkGithub` class. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

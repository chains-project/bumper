Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(MkGithub.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(MkGithub.class);
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch adds a `Tv` instance for the `MkGithub` class, which is used by the `Tv` aspect to generate traces. The `Tv` instance is created using the `Tv` constructor that takes a class as an argument, and then the `add` method is called on the `T` instance to add the `MkGithub` class to the trace.


With this patch, the error message complaining about the missing `Tv` aspect should be resolved.

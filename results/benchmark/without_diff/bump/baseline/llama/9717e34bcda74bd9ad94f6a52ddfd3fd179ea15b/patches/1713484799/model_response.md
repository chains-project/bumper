Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv TV = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TV.println("Hello, GitHub!");
    }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and uses it to call the `println` method.
The `Tv` class is not visible in the provided code snippet, so it's assumed that it's a custom class.
The patch fixes the error by providing a valid reference to the `Tv` class.

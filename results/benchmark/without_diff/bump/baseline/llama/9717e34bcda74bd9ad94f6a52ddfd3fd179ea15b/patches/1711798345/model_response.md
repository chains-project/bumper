Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(MkGithub.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(MkGithub.class, "main", args));
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the `main` method is not overriding any method in the new version. It also adds a `Tv` instance for the `MkGithub` class, which is required by the `com.jcabi.aspects` library.

Note that this patch assumes that the error is caused by the missing `Tv` instance for the `MkGithub` class. If the error persists after applying this patch, it may be necessary to provide more information about the error message and the context in which it occurs.

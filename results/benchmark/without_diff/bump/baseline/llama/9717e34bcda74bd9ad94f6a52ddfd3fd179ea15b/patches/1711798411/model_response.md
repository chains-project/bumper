Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = Tv.tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.println("Hello, GitHub!");
    }
}
```
The patch includes a static import of the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, which is likely the missing dependency. By adding this import, the code should now compile without errors.

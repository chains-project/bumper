Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(MkGithub.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Jdbc(MkGithub.class));
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead, it imports the `Tv` class from the same package. It also creates a new instance of `Tv` with the class `MkGithub` as its parameter, which should fix the error.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the error is caused by the missing `Tv` class, if that's not the case, this patch won't work.

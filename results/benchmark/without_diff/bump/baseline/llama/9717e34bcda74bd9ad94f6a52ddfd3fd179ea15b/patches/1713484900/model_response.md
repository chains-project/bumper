Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private Tv tv;

    public MkGithub(Tv tv) {
        this.tv = tv;
    }

    public void fetch(Github github) {
        tv.add(github);
    }
}
```
The patch adds a constructor to the `MkGithub` class that takes a `Tv` instance as a parameter. The `Tv` instance is then stored in a field called `tv`. The `fetch` method is modified to add the `Github` instance to the `tv` instance using the `add` method.

This patch fixes the error by providing a way to inject the `Tv` instance that is required by the `MkGithub` class. By adding a constructor that takes a `Tv` instance, the class can now be instantiated with a valid `Tv` instance, which is then stored in the `tv` field. This allows the `fetch` method to work correctly and avoids the error caused by the missing `Tv` instance.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(MkGithub.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Jdbc(MkGithub.class));
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the `main` method is not overriding any method in the new version. It also adds a `Tv` instance for the `MkGithub` class, which is used by the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class to provide tracing information.

With this patch, the code should compile and run without any issues.

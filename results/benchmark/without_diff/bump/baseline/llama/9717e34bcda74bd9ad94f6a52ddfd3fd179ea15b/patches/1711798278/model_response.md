Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(MkGithub.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.AfterAspect());
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.BeforeAspect());
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.AroundAspect());
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.AfterReturningAspect());
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.AfterThrowingAspect());
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.BeforeAspect(Tv.class));
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation from the `main` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. The `Tv` class is also imported and used to create a new instance of the `Tv` aspect, which is then used to add various aspect methods to the advice chain.

It is important to note that this patch assumes that the `com.jcabi.aspects` package is available and accessible to the client code. If the package is not available, additional modifications to the code may be necessary to fix the error.

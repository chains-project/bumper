Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private PBEPasswordEncoder encoder;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        // Create a new PBEPasswordEncoder instance
        encoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
    }

    public String encodePassword(String password) {
        return encoder.encodePassword(password);
    }
}
```
Replace the failing client code with the proposed patch, which imports the required library and creates a new instance of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class. The `encodePassword` method is then overridden to call the corresponding method on the `encoder` instance.

It is important to note that this patch assumes that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class is available in the project's classpath. If the library is not available, you may need to add it as a dependency in your project's build configuration.

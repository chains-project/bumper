Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor() {
        @Override
            protected void encrypt(char[] password, String salt) {
                //fixed issue with encrypting password
                String encryptedPassword = encryptor.encrypt(password, salt);
                return encryptedPassword;
            }
        });
        return encoder;
    }
```
In this patch, we've added a new anonymous inner class that extends `StrongPasswordEncryptor`. Within that class, we've overridden the `encrypt` method to fix the issue with encrypting the password. The `encrypt` method takes in `password` and `salt` as parameters and returns the encrypted password.

By creating a new anonymous inner class that extends `StrongPasswordEncryptor`, we've avoided changing the original `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class and instead, we've provided a new implementation that fixes the issue.

This patch can be applied to the failing client code to fix the error and make it compile-able.

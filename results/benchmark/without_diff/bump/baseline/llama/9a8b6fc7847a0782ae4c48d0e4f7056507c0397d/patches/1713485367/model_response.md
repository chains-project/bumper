The issue is caused by an incompatible version of the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` library. This patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the `salt` array has a length of 16, which is the expected length for the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` constructor.

The `encrypt` method of the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class is overridden to check if the `salt` array has a length of 16, and if not, it initializes a new array with the correct length and fills it with zeros.

This patch does not require any changes to the method signature, and it does not remove any functionality. It only adds a check to ensure that the `salt` array has the correct length, which is necessary for the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` constructor to work correctly.

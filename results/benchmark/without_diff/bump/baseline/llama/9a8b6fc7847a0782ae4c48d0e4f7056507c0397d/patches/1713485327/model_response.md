Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor() {
        @Override
            protected void encrypt(char[] password, String salt) {
                // Remove this line, it's not needed
                // password = Arrays.toString(password);
                super.encrypt(password, salt);
            }
        });
        return encoder;
    }
```
The issue is that the `PasswordEncoder` class is trying to use the `Arrays.toString()` method, which is not available in the Android dependency.
By removing the line that uses this method, the error is fixed.

It's important to note that this fix assumes that the `Arrays.toString()` method is not being used anywhere else in the code, and that it's safe to remove it. If this method is being used elsewhere, a different approach will be needed.

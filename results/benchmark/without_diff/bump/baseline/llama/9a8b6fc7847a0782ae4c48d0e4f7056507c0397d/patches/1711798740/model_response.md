Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder implements PasswordEncoder {
    private final PasswordEncoder delegate;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        delegate = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        return delegate.encode(rawPassword);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return delegate.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we've replaced the import statement for `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` with `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder`. We've also removed the `PBEPasswordEncoder` constructor argument, as it's not needed.

Additionally, we've created a new `PasswordEncoder` implementation, `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder`, that delegates all its methods to a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance. This allows us to use the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the Spring Security library, which is not affected by the dependency update.

With this patch, the client code should now compile and work as expected.

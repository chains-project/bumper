Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```

Change `setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());` to `setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor() {
            @Override
            public String encrypt(CharSequence password) {
                return encryptPassword(password);
            }
        });`

The `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class is not available in the current version of the dependency, so we're creating an anonymous class that implements the `PasswordEncryptor` interface and overrides the `encrypt` method to call the `encryptPassword` method, which is not part of the removed `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class.

This change should allow the code to compile and run without errors.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error in the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.create(SshByPassword.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and assigns it a new instance of `Tv` created with the `Tv.create()` method, passing `SshByPassword.class` as an argument. This should fix the error by providing a valid reference to the `Tv` class.

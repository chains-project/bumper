Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(SshByPassword.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(SshByPassword.class, "main", args));
        com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword ssh = new com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword();
        ssh.setPassword("my_secret_password");
        ssh.setHost("my_host");
        ssh.setPort(22);
        ssh.setUsername("my_username");
        ssh.connect();
        System.out.println("Connected to server");
        ssh.disconnect();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead, it imports `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and creates a new instance of `Tv` with the class `SshByPassword` as its argument. This instance is then used to add a method to the aspect jar.

Additionally, the patch removes the `Override` annotation from the `main` method as it is not necessary.

The rest of the code remains unchanged.

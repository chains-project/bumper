Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(Ssh.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(Ssh.class, "main", new Class<?>[] {String[].class}, new Object[] {args}));
    }
}
```
The patch removes the annotation `@Override` because it's not necessary, as the method `main` is not overriding any method in the new version.
It also adds a variable `T` to make the code easier to understand.
The `Tv` class is used to log the method calls, it's not necessary to change the signature of the `main` method.
The `Method` class is used to add a method call to the `Tv` class, it's not necessary to change the signature of the `main` method.

Please note that this is a simple patch, and it may not work in all cases, it's important to test it thoroughly before using it in production.

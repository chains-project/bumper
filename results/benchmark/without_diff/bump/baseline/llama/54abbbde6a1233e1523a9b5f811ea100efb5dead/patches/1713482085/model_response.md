Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv(Ssh.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. The `Tv` class is also imported and used to create a new instance of the `Tv` class, which is then used to print a message to the console.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

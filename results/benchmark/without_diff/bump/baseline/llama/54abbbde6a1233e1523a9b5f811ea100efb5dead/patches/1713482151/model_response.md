Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(Ssh.class, "main", new Class<?>[] { String[].class }, new Object[] { args }));
    }
}
```
The patch removes the error by providing a valid signature for the `main` method that matches the one defined in the `Tv` class. The `Tv` class is also imported and used to create a new instance of the `Tv` class, which is then used to add a method to the `Tv` class.

It's important to note that this patch is just a proposal, and it may not work in all cases. It's possible that the error is caused by a different issue, and in that case, this patch will not fix the problem.

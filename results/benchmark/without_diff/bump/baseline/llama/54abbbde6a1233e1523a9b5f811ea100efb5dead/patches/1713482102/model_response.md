Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(Ssh.class, "main", args));
        com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.aspect(Ssh.class).before("main", args);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `T` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv`. The `Tv` class is being used to track method calls and their arguments. The `main` method is then modified to add the method call to the `Tv` instance using the `add` method and also invoking the `before` method of the `Tv` aspect to intercept the `main` method call.

It's important to note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the error. Additionally, this solution assumes that the `Tv` class and its methods are available and compatible with the code.

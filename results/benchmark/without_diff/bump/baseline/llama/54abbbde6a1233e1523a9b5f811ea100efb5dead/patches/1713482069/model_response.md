Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class Ssh {
    private static final Tv T = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        T.add(new com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.Method(Ssh.class, "main", args));
        com.jcabi.aspects.Tv.aspect(Ssh.class).before("main", args);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a private static final variable `T` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv`. The `Tv` class is being used to provide timing and monitoring utilities.

In the `main` method, we add a method aspect using the `T.add()` method, passing in the `Ssh` class, the `main` method, and the `args` parameter. We then call the `before()` method of the `Tv` aspect to execute any advice that may have been registered.

This patch should fix the error by providing a valid reference to the `Tv` class.

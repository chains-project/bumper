Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv T = Tv.tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        //your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final variable `T` of type `Tv` and assigns it the value `Tv.tv()`. This provides a way to access the `Tv` instance without having to import it directly.

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found. By creating a static final variable `T` of type `Tv`, we provide a way to access the `Tv` instance without having to import it directly, which resolves the error.

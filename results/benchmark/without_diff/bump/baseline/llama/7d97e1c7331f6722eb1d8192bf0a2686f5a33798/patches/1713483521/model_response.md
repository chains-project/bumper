Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.VOID;

    public void testRegion() {
        // Remove the following line, as it's not needed
        // Tv.set(Tv.VOID);
        // Add the following line to use the static final variable we created
        Tv.set(TV);
        // Rest of the code...
    }
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `Tv` class was not in the classpath, so we imported it and created a static final variable `TV` to reference it. Then, we removed the line that was causing the error and replaced it with a call to the `Tv.set()` method using the `TV` variable.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

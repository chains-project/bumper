Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        Tv.set(Tv.UNIT_TEST);
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` and sets it to a new instance of `Tv`. This allows the code to use `Tv` without any issues.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is still available and has the same signature as before. If the `Tv` class has been modified or removed, a different patch may be necessary.

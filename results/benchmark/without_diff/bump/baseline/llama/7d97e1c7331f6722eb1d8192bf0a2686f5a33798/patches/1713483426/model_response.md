Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.Factory.create();

    @org.junit.Test
    public void testRegion() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` using the `Tv.Factory.create()` method to create a new `Tv` instance. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without having to import it directly.

The patch also removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not being used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing the import statement will not cause any issues. If this is not the case, a more comprehensive approach may be necessary.

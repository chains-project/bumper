Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSomething() {
        Tv.set(Tv. television(Tv.Category.INFO));
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` that is initialized with a new instance of `Tv`, and then uses that instance to call `television` method.
This should fix the error by providing a valid instance of `Tv` that can be used to call the `television` method.
It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class has a public constructor, if that's not the case, you might need to modify the patch accordingly.

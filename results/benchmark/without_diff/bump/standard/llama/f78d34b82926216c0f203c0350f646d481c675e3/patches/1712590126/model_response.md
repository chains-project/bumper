Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
// replace the line
first = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(first);
last = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(last);

// with
first = com.mojang.authlib.Utils.convertToLeet(first);
last = com.mojang.authlib.Utils.convertToLeet(last);
```
This patch replaces the reference to the non-existent `develop.p2p.lib` package with the `com.mojang.authlib` package, which contains the `Utils` class with the `convertToLeet` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `com.mojang.authlib` package is available in the project's classpath. If it's not, you may need to add it as a dependency in your build configuration.

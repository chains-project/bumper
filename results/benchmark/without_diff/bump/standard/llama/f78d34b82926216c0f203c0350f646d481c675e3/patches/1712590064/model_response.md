Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
// Replace the line with the following code:
first = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(first);
last = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(last);

// With:
first = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.stripAccents(first);
last = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.stripAccents(last);
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `develop.p2p.lib` package does not exist. To fix this, we can replace the `LeetConverter` class with a different class that can perform the same function. In this case, we can use `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.stripAccents` method to remove accents from the strings, which should achieve the same result as the `LeetConverter` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `org.apache.commons.lang3` package is available, which is a common package in Java. If this package is not available, a different solution may be needed.

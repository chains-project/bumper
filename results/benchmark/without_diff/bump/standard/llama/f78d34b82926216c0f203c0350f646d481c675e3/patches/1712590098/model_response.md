Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
// Replace the line with the following code:
first = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(first);
last = develop.p2p.lib.LeetConverter.convert(last);

// With:
first = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(first);
last = org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(last);
```
This patch replaces the reference to the non-existent `develop.p2p.lib` package with the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils` class, which provides similar functionality for escaping special characters in strings.

Note that this patch assumes that the `StringEscapeUtils` class is available in the project's classpath. If it's not, you may need to add the appropriate dependency to your project's build configuration.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// Replace the failing method with the following code:
public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private static final PBEPasswordEncoder encoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();

    public static String encode(String password) {
        return encoder.encode(password);
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the non-existent package `org.jasypt.spring.security` with the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package, which is available in the Spring Security library.

The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has the same methods as the one from the non-existent package, so the replacement should not cause any issues. The `encode` method is also kept the same, as it is not affected by the package change.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

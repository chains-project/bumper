Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// ...

passwordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. After researching, I found that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been moved to the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package in Spring Security 5.

Therefore, we can fix the error by updating the import statement and replacing `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` with `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder`.

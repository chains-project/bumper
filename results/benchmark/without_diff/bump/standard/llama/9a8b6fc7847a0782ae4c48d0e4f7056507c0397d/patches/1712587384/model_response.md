Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// Replace the failing line with the following code:
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. After researching, I found that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been moved to the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package in Spring Security 5.

Therefore, we can replace the import statement with the following code:
```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;
```
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed. The method signature remains the same, but the `Override` annotation is not needed because the method is not overriding any method in the new version.


The patch also removes the `getTime()` method call on the `super.between(from, to)` expression, as it is not necessary to call this method. The `between()` method of the `DateAndTime` class already returns a `Timestamp` object, so we can directly return it without calling `getTime()`.


Here's the patch in code:
```diff
-@Override
-  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
-      return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
-  }
+  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
+      return super.between(from, to);
+  }
```
This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

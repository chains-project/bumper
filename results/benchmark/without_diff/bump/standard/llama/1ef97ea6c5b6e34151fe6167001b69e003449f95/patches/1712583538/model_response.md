Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
Replace the failing method with the following code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return Timestamp.from(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
The change is in the line `return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());`. Instead of creating a new `Timestamp` instance using the `getTime()` method, we use the `Timestamp.from()` method to create a new `Timestamp` instance from the `Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)`. This avoids the incompatible types error and correctly converts the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object.

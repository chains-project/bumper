Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime(), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```
The issue is that the `between` method in the `DateAndTime` class returns a `Date` object, which cannot be converted to a `Timestamp` directly. To fix this, we can modify the `between` method to create a new `Timestamp` object with the same milliseconds as the `Date` object, and then return it.


Here's the modified code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    Date date = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime(), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```
This code creates a new `Timestamp` object with the same milliseconds as the `Date` object returned by the `between` method, and then returns it. This should fix the incompatible types error.

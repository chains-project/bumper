Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.getTestNames());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```
The patch replaces the call to `getWildcard()` with `getTestNames()`, which is a method added in the same version of the Surefire plugin that introduced the `getWildcard()` method. `getTestNames()` returns a list of test names, which can be used to initialize the `DirectoryScanner` instead of relying on the removed `getWildcard()` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TestListResolver` class is still available and has the same signature as before. If the class has been modified or removed, a different patch may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringMatches(false, java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
The patch replaces `org.hamcrest.core.StringContains` with `org.hamcrest.core.StringMatches`, which has a different constructor that takes a boolean and a string, and no longer has the issue with the formal argument list differing in length.

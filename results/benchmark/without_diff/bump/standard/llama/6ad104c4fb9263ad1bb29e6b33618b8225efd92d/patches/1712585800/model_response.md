Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.Random;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    private static final Random random = new SecureRandom();

    public static void decode(byte[] input) {
        // ...
        byte[] nonce = new byte[12];
        random.nextBytes(nonce);
        // ...
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This package is likely being used in the code to handle TLS-related operations. However, since the package is not available, we need to find an alternative way to generate random numbers, which is what the `SecureRandom` class is used for.

In the patch, we first import the `SecureRandom` class from the `java.security` package. We then create an instance of `SecureRandom` and use it to generate a 12-byte nonce, which is used in the `ChachaDecoder` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `SecureRandom` class is available and accessible in the code. If the `SecureRandom` class is also not available, an alternative random number generation method would need to be used.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

// Add a variable to store the result of assumeTrue
boolean canRun = assumeTrue(true);

// Use the variable instead of calling assumeTrue directly
if (canRun) {
    // Your code that uses assumeTrue here
}
```
This patch introduces a variable `canRun` that is set to the result of `assumeTrue(true)`. Then, it uses this variable instead of calling `assumeTrue` directly in the code that uses it.

This should fix the error because the `assumeTrue` method is only called once and its result is stored in the `canRun` variable. Therefore, the error about static import should be resolved.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import static java.util.Objects.requireNonNull;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `assumeTrue` method is not a member of the `org.junit.Assume` class. This is because the `assumeTrue` method was removed in Java 11 and later versions. To fix this issue, we can replace the import statement with a static import of the `requireNonNull` method from the `java.util` package, which is available in Java 11 and later versions. This method can be used in place of `assumeTrue` to achieve the same functionality.

Here's the modified code with the proposed patch applied:
```java
import static java.util.Objects.requireNonNull;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // ...
}
```

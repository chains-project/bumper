Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    public void testSomething() {
        Assume.assumeTrue(true);
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `static` keyword from the import statement, as `assumeTrue` is a method from the `org.junit.Assume` class, not a static import.

Note that this patch assumes that the `assumeTrue` method is being used in the code, if it's not being used, the import statement can be removed altogether.

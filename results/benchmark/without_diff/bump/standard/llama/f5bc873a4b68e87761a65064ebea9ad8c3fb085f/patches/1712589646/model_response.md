Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;

// Create a new variable to hold the scanner
DirectoryScanner scanner = new DirectoryScanner();

// Modify the line that was causing the error
scanner.setIncludes("**/*.xhtml,**/*.js,**/*.css");
```
This patch creates a new variable `scanner` to hold the `DirectoryScanner` object, and modifies the line that was causing the error by using the `setIncludes()` method instead of the `setIncludes()` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the error is caused by the `setIncludes()` method being removed in the newer version of the `DirectoryScanner` class. By creating a new variable and using the `setIncludes()` method, we avoid the need to use the removed method and instead use the recommended alternative.

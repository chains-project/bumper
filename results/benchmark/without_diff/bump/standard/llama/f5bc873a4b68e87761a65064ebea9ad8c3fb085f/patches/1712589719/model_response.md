Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;

// Create a variable to hold the DirectoryScanner instance
DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner();

// Replace the failing line with the following code
directoryScanner.scan(basedir, includes, excludes, scanAllDirectories, scanManifests);
```
This patch creates a variable `directoryScanner` to hold the `DirectoryScanner` instance, and then uses that variable to call the `scan` method instead of calling it directly on the class. This should fix the error by providing a valid instance of `DirectoryScanner` to call the method on.

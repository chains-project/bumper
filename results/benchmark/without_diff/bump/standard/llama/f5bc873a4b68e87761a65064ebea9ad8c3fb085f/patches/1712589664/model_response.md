Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;

// Create a new variable to hold the scanner
DirectoryScanner scanner = new DirectoryScanner();

// Replace the failing line with the following code
scanner.scan(basedir, includes, excludes, scanAllDirectories);
```
This patch creates a new variable `scanner` to hold the `DirectoryScanner` instance, and then uses that variable to call the `scan()` method instead of calling it directly on the class. This avoids the issue of the dependencies not being available.

Note that this patch assumes that the `basedir`, `includes`, and `excludes` variables are already defined and have the correct values. If they are not defined or have incorrect values, additional changes may be needed to the code.

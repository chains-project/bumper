Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.DirectoryScanner;

// Create a new variable to hold the scanner instance
DirectoryScanner scanner = new DirectoryScanner();

// Modify the line that was causing the error
scanner.setIncludes("**/*.xhtml,**/*.js,**/*.css");
```
This patch creates a new variable `scanner` to hold the `DirectoryScanner` instance, and modifies the line that was causing the error by setting the `includes` property of the `scanner` instance instead of directly calling the `setIncludes` method on the `DirectoryScanner` class.

This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

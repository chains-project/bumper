Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;

// Create a variable to hold the RenderingContext instance
RenderingContext renderingContext = null;

// Check if the RenderingContext instance is null
if (renderingContext == null) {
  // Create a new RenderingContext instance if it's null
  renderingContext = new RenderingContext();
}

// Use the renderingContext instance to render the XHTML
renderingContext.render(xhtml);
```
This patch creates a variable `renderingContext` to hold the `RenderingContext` instance, and checks if it's null before creating a new instance if necessary. This ensures that the `RenderingContext` instance is properly initialized before it's used to render the XHTML.

Note that this patch assumes that the `RenderingContext` class is not modified and is still located in the same package. If the class has been modified or moved to a different package, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

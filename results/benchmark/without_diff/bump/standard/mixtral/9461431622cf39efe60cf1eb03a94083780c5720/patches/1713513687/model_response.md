Here's a possible patch for the given client code. The issue is caused by a type mismatch between the `SortedMap` returned by `server.getRegistry()` and the expected type for the registry field.

By changing the type of the `reg` variable to `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>`, we can avoid the type mismatch error.
```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```
Note that this patch may not be complete, as it's possible that the type mismatch error is caused by other parts of the code that are not shown here. However, this should fix the immediate issue with the given client code.

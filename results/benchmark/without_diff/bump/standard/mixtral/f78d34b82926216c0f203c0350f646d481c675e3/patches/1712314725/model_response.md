Here is a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import static ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions.sigmoid;
```
This patch imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions` class instead of the original `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class. This assumes that the `ai.djl` library is available and that it provides a `sigmoid` function that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original one.

Note that this patch only changes the import statement and does not modify the rest of the client code. This is because the original code snippet only contains an import statement and does not show how the imported `sigmoid` function is used. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more specific fix without additional context.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
import static tech.peyang.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```
Note that I replaced `develop.p2p.lib` with `tech.peyang.lib` to fix the error. This assumes that the `sigmoid` method is available in the new package. If not, you may need to modify the code further to import the correct method or package.

Here's a proposed patch that you can apply to the code:
```java
import static tech.peyang.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```
Note that I replaced the package name `develop.p2p.lib` with `tech.peyang.lib`, assuming that this is the correct package where the `LearnMath` class is located. If this is not the case, please provide the correct package name and I will update the patch accordingly.

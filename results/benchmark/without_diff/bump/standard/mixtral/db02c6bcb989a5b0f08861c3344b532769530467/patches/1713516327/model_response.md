Here is a potential patch for the code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
The issue with the original code is that the `StringContains` constructor is being called with two arguments, but it only expects one. The patch removes the first argument (the boolean value `false`) to fix the error.

Here is a potential patch for the given client code:
```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport.Factory factory = new TFramedTransport.Factory();
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = factory.getTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os));
    framedTransport.setFramedTransportBufferSize(bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
This patch uses the `TFramedTransport.Factory` to create a `TFramedTransport` instance, which should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error. It also sets the buffer capacity using the `setFramedTransportBufferSize` method. Note that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been replaced with `TFramedTransport` and the buffer capacity is set after the transport is created.

Here is a potential patch for the given failing method:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch replaces the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class, which is an added library method identified with `++`. The `TFramedTransport` class provides similar functionality to the `TFastFramedTransport` class, but it is part of the core Thrift library and should be more widely available.

Note that the `TFramedTransport` class does not have a constructor that takes a `LogMessageEncoder` object as a parameter, so the `LogMessageEncoder` object has been removed from the constructor call. This may require additional changes to the code to properly encode the log messages.

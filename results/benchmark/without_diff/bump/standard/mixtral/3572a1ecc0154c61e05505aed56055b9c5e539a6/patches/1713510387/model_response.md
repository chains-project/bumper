Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport`, which is a part of the Apache Thrift library. The `TFastFramedTransport` class is not found, so it's reasonable to assume that this class was removed or renamed in a recent update. By using `TFramedTransport`, the code should work again, as it provides similar functionality.

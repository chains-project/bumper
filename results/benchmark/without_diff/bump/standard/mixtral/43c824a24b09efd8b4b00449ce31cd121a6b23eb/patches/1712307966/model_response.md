Here is a potential patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, (JsonBranch) branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

The proposed patch introduces a type cast on the `branch` parameter in the `extractList` method call. This assumes that the `branch` parameter is always an instance of `JsonBranch`. If this is not the case, a `ClassCastException` may be thrown. It would be safer to modify the method signature to accept a `JsonBranch` parameter instead of an `Object` parameter. However, since the original method signature cannot be changed, this is the best solution that can be provided.

Additionally, it is assumed that the `JsonBranch` class is still available in the classpath and has not been removed or renamed. If this is not the case, then a different solution would be required.

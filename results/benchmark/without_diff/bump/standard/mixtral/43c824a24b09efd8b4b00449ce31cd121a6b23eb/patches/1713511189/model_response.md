Here's a fixed version of the `extractFirst` method that removes the dependency on `JsonBranch`:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

In this version, I've removed the `branch` parameter from the method signature, as well as the usage of `branch` in the method body. This should fix the compilation error caused by the missing `JsonBranch` class. However, note that this change may affect the functionality of the method, since it no longer takes a `JsonBranch` object as input. You may need to modify the method further to meet your requirements.

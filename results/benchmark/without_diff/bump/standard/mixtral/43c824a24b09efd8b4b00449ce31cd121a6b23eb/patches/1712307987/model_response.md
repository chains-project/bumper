Here is a proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

In this patch, I changed the type of the `branch` parameter from `JsonBranch` to `Object`. This is because the error message suggests that the `JsonBranch` class is not found. By changing the type to `Object`, we can avoid this error and still pass in a `JsonBranch` object. However, this change means that we lose some type safety, so it's important to make sure that the `extractList` method can handle `Object` arguments.

Here is a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

import java.security.Security;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // Add the following lines at the beginning of the class
    static {
        Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    }

    // Existing code
}
```
In addition to importing the necessary package, the patch initializes the BouncyCastle provider using the `Security.addProvider()` method. This ensures that the required classes are available at runtime.

Note that the `BouncyCastleProvider` class is a part of the Bouncy Castle library and must be added as a dependency to the project.

The `Security.addProvider()` method should be called once during the application startup, preferably in a static block as shown in the patch. This ensures that the provider is registered before any cryptographic operations are performed.

By making this change, the client code should be able to resolve the dependency and compile successfully.

Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that uses the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class. This way, the code can still use the `AlertDescription` class from the Bouncy Castle library, even if the package name has changed.

Note that this patch assumes that the Bouncy Castle library is still available on the classpath, and that its version is compatible with the code. If the library is not available or incompatible, then more extensive changes may be necessary.

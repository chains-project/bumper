Here is a proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note: I have changed the package name from `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` to `org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls` to fix the error.

The error message suggests that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, which means that the package name in the import statement might be incorrect or the library is not present in the classpath.

By changing the package name to `org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls`, the code should be able to compile successfully. However, please note that this change assumes that the correct version of the `bouncecastle` library is present in the classpath. If the library is not present or an incorrect version is being used, then additional changes might be required.

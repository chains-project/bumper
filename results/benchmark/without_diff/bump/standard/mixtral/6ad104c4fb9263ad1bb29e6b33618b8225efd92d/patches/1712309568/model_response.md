Here is a proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note: I have changed the package name from `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` to `org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls` (changed '.' to ','). This is just an example and may not work depending on the actual package name and its availability.

The error message suggests that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. To resolve this issue, you can either add the missing dependency to your project or modify the code to use a different package that provides similar functionality.

In this case, I have assumed that there is a typo in the package name and have corrected it. However, if the package name is correct and the dependency is missing, you need to add the following dependency to your project:

For Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
  <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
  <version>1.68</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:
```groovy
implementation 'org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:1.68'
```

This will add the missing dependency to your project and resolve the error.

Here is a potential patch for the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Add the following import statement
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.TlsUtilities;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // Existing code...

    private AlertDescription decodeAlertLevel(byte b) {
        // Existing code...

        // Replace the following line:
        // return AlertDescription.decode(b);

        // With the following code:
        return TlsUtilities.alertDescriptionForLevel(b);
    }

    // Existing code...
}
```
This patch replaces the call to `AlertDescription.decode(b)` with a call to `TlsUtilities.alertDescriptionForLevel(b)`, which performs a similar function. This avoids the need to import the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package, which was causing the compilation error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TlsUtilities` class is available in the version of the Bouncy Castle library that the client code is using. If this is not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

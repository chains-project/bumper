Here's a fixed version of the client code that replaces the failing import statement:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
This code imports the `AlertDescription` class from the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package, which is a different package than the original import statement. This should fix the error message that the original package does not exist.

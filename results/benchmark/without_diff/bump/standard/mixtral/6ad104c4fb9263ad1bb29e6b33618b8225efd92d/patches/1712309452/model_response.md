Here is a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note: I noticed that there is a typo in the package name in the original code. It should be "bouncecastle" instead of "bouncycastle". I have corrected it in the proposed patch.

Additionally, I cannot provide a solution that uses an added library method, as there are no such methods available in the given error message.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Add the following import statement
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.TlsUtilities;

// Replace the following line of code
// AlertDescription description = AlertDescription.decode(exchange.getAlertLevel(), input.readByte());

// With the following lines of code
byte[] decoded = TlsUtilities.ensureEnoughData(input, 2);
AlertDescription description = AlertDescription.forCode(decoded[1] & 0xFF);
```
In this patch, we add a new import statement to bring in the `TlsUtilities` class from the Bouncy Castle library. We then replace the failing line of code with a new implementation that uses `TlsUtilities.ensureEnoughData()` to ensure that there is enough data in the `input` stream before trying to decode the alert description. We then use a bitwise AND operation to extract the second byte of the decoded data and pass it to `AlertDescription.forCode()` to get the corresponding alert description.

Note that this patch assumes that the `input` object is an instance of `InputStream` or a subclass of `InputStream`. If this assumption is not valid, the patch may need to be modified accordingly. Additionally, this patch assumes that the `exchange` object is not used in the rest of the method. If this assumption is not valid, the patch may need to be modified to preserve the original behavior of the `exchange` object.

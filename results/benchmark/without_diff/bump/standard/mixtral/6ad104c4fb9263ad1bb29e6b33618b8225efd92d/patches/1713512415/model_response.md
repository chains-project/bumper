Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;

// Add the following import statement
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.TlsUtilities;

// Replace the following line of code
// TlsUtilities.checkUint16(in, 2, "handshake messages", "version");

// With the following lines of code
int major = TlsUtilities.readUint8(in);
int minor = TlsUtilities.readUint8(in);
if (major > 3 || (major == 3 && minor > 1)) {
    throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.unsupported_version);
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This package contains the `TlsUtilities` class, which provides several utility methods for TLS handshake messages.

One of the methods that is used in the failing code is `TlsUtilities.checkUint16(in, 2, "handshake messages", "version")`. This method checks if the next two bytes in the input stream `in` form a valid unsigned 16-bit integer, and throws an exception if they don't.

To fix the error, we can replace this method call with the following lines of code:
```java
int major = TlsUtilities.readUint8(in);
int minor = TlsUtilities.readUint8(in);
```
These lines of code read the next two bytes in the input stream `in` and interpret them as an unsigned 8-bit integer each. We can then check if the major version number (represented by `major`) is greater than 3 or if the major version number is 3 and the minor version number (represented by `minor`) is greater than 1. If either of these conditions is true, we can throw a `TlsFatalAlert` with the `unsupported_version` description.

Note that this fix assumes that the major version number is encoded in the most significant byte and the minor version number is encoded in the least significant byte. This is the usual convention for TLS version numbers.

Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between `Date` and `Timestamp`. However, the code you provided already correctly converts the `Date` object returned by `super.between` to a `Timestamp` by calling `getTime()` and passing the result to the `Timestamp` constructor.

Therefore, the issue is likely caused by a version mismatch between the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes used in the code. Specifically, the `Date` class used in the `between` method may be from a different version of the Java SDK than the `Timestamp` class.

To fix the issue, you can try specifying the fully-qualified names of the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes in the `between` method, like this:

```java
import java.sql.Date;
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This ensures that the correct versions of the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes are used in the `between` method.

If this does not resolve the issue, you may need to update the version of the Java SDK used by your project to ensure that the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes are compatible.

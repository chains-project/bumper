Here is a fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `between` method in the superclass `DateAndTime` returns a `Date` object, but the method signature specifies that it should return a `Timestamp` object.

To fix this, you can simply create a new `Timestamp` object by calling the `getTime` method on the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between` method. This will convert the `Date` object to a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch, and then create a new `Timestamp` object using this value.

I apologize for any confusion, but the original code you provided was actually already correct and did not need to be changed. The error message you provided suggests that there is a type mismatch between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`, but this is not actually an issue in the `between` method itself. Instead, it is likely that the issue is caused by a type mismatch elsewhere in the code, such as when the `Timestamp` object returned by the `between` method is passed to a method or stored in a variable that expects a `Date` object.

To fix this issue, you will need to identify the location in the code where the type mismatch is occurring and update it to use the correct type (`Timestamp` instead of `Date`). For example, if the `Timestamp` object returned by the `between` method is being passed to a method that expects a `Date` object, you can fix the issue by converting the `Timestamp` object to a `Date` object using the `toDate` method before passing it to the method.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
    Date date = new Date(timestamp.getTime());
    // Pass the `date` object to the method that expects a `Date` object
    someMethodThatExpectsADate(date);
    return timestamp;
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change I made is to specify the fully-qualified names for the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes, since it seems like there is a conflict between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date`. This way, the method knows to use `java.util.Date` for the `from` and `to` parameters, and `java.sql.Timestamp` for the return type.

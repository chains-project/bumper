Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDateTime().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant().toEpochMilli();
}
```

This version converts the `Date` objects returned by `super.between` to `LocalDateTime` objects, which can be converted to a `Timestamp` without issues. The `ZoneId.systemDefault()` method is used to convert between time zones, which is necessary to get the correct number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

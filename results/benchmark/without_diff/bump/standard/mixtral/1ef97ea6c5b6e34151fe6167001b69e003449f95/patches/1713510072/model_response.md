Here's the proposed patch for the failing `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, based on the error message, it seems that the issue is caused by the return type of the method, which is `Timestamp`, while the superclass's `between` method returns a `Date`. To fix this issue, you can change the return type of the `between` method to `Date` and then convert the result to `Timestamp` in the client code that calls this method.

Here's the updated `between` method with the return type changed to `Date`:

```java
@Override
public Date between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return super.between(from, to);
}
```

And here's an example of how you can use this updated method in the client code:

```java
DateTime dateTime = new DateTime(faker);
Date from = ...; // initialize from
Date to = ...; // initialize to
Date result = dateTime.between(from, to);
Timestamp timestampResult = new Timestamp(result.getTime());
```

Note that this solution assumes that the client code can be modified. If the client code cannot be modified, then you may need to find a different solution, such as creating a wrapper class that converts between `Date` and `Timestamp`.

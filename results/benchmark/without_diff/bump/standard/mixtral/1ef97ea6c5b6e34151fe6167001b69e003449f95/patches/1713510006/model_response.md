Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change made is to specify the fully qualified names for the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes, so that the correct classes are used. The error message suggests that the `Date` class being used is `java.util.Date` instead of `java.sql.Date`, which is why the conversion fails. By specifying the fully qualified names, we ensure that the correct classes are used.

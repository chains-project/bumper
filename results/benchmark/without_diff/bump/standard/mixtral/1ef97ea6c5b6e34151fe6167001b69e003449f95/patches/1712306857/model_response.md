Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS);
}
```

In this version, we create a new `Timestamp` object from the `Date` returned by the superclass's `between` method. Then, we convert the `Timestamp` to an `Instant` using its `toInstant()` method. Finally, we truncate the `Instant` to the nearest millisecond using the `truncatedTo()` method of the `ChronoUnit` class. This ensures that the resulting `Instant` can be converted back to a `Timestamp` without losing any precision.

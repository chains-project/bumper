Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

In this patch, I've added explicit type declarations for the method parameters and return type to ensure that the correct types are used. This should resolve the incompatible types error.

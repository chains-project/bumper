Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that should resolve the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS).toEpochMilli();
}
```

This version of the method converts the `Date` object returned by `super.between` to an `Instant` using the `toInstant()` method. It then truncates the `Instant` to the nearest millisecond using `truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS)`. Finally, it converts the truncated `Instant` back to a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch using `toEpochMilli()`. This value is then used to create a new `Timestamp` object.

The error in the original version of the method was caused by the fact that a `Date` object cannot be directly converted to a `Timestamp` object. Instead, a `Date` object must be converted to a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch, and this value can then be used to create a `Timestamp` object. The fixed version of the method does this conversion explicitly using the `toInstant()` and `toEpochMilli()` methods.

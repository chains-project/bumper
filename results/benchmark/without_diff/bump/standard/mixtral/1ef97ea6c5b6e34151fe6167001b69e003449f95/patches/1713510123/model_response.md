Here's a patch that you can apply to the `between` method in the `DateTime` class:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The issue here is that the `between` method in the `DateAndTime` class returns a `Date` object, but the `between` method in the `DateTime` class is expected to return a `Timestamp` object.

One way to fix this issue is to convert the `Date` object returned by the `super.between` method to a `Timestamp` object using the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `long` argument representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT.

However, since the `getTime` method of the `Date` class returns a `long` representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT, we can simply call this method on the `Date` object returned by `super.between` and pass the result to the `Timestamp` constructor.

Here's the updated `between` method with this change:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This should fix the incompatible types error and allow the `DateTime` class to compile and run successfully.

Here is a fixed version of the failing method:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change I made is to specify the fully-qualified names of the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes. This is necessary because the `Date` class is being imported from two different packages (`java.util` and `java.sql`), and the Java compiler cannot determine which one to use without explicit guidance. By using the fully-qualified names, we ensure that the correct version of the `Date` class is used.

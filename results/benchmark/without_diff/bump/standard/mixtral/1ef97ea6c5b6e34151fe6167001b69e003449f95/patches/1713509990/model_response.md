Here is a fixed version of the failing method:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

In this fixed version, I've changed the return type of the method from `Timestamp` to `java.sql.Timestamp`, and I've also changed the type of the `from` and `to` parameters from `Date` to `java.util.Date`. This is necessary because the `Date` class in the `java.util` package is not compatible with the `Timestamp` class in the `java.sql` package. By using the fully-qualified names for these classes, we can ensure that the correct versions are being used.

Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that returns a `Timestamp` instead of a `Date`:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, the error message you provided indicates that the problem is not with the method itself, but with the return type. It seems that the method signature of the overridden method in the superclass `DateAndTime` has been changed in a way that is not compatible with the `between` method in the `DateTime` class.

To fix this issue, you can change the return type of the `between` method in the `DateTime` class to `Date` instead of `Timestamp`. This will ensure that the method is compatible with the overridden method in the superclass:

```java
@Override
public Date between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return super.between(from, to);
}
```

Alternatively, you can update the method signature of the overridden method in the superclass `DateAndTime` to return a `Timestamp` instead of a `Date`. This will allow the `between` method in the `DateTime` class to continue returning a `Timestamp`:

```java
public class DateAndTime {
    // ...

    @Override
    public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Either of these solutions should fix the error you are seeing.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

In the above patch, I have fully qualified the `Timestamp` and `Date` classes with their respective packages. This ensures that the correct classes are being used throughout the method. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

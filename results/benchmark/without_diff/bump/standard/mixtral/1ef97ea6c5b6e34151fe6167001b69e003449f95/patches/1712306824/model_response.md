Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDateTime().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant().toEpochMilli();
}
```

This version converts the `Date` objects returned by the `super.between` method to `LocalDateTime` objects using the `atZone` method of the `Instant` class. It then converts the `LocalDateTime` objects back to `Instant` objects using the `atZone` method of the `ZonedDateTime` class. Finally, it converts the `Instant` objects to `Timestamp` objects using the `toEpochMilli` method of the `Instant` class.

This version of the method should be compatible with the updated version of the external dependency that caused the error.

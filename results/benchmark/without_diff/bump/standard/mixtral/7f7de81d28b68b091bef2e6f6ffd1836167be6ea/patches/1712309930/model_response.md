Here's a possible patch for the given code. I changed the type of the `reg` variable to `Map` and used the `putAll` method to add the new entry:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = new TreeMap<>();
        reg.putAll(server.getRegistry());
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

This patch should fix the error because it avoids the incompatible types error by using the `putAll` method to add the new entry to the map.

Note that this patch uses the `TreeMap` class, which is a sorted map implementation that implements the `SortedMap` interface. This means that the order of the entries in the map is preserved and the map maintains the keys in ascending order, according to their natural ordering or according to a `Comparator` provided at map creation time. If the original code relies on the fact that the map is sorted, then this patch should work as expected. If not, then you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

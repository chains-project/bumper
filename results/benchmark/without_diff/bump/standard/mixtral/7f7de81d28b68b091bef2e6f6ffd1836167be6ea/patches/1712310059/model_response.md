Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method. The issue seems to be caused by a type mismatch between the declared type of the `reg` variable and the type of the `registry` field. I'm assuming that the `registry` field has been changed to use a raw type (i.e., `SortedMap` instead of `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`) in the new version of the external dependency. To fix this, you can use an unchecked cast when assigning the value of `server.getRegistry()` to `reg`. This will suppress the type-safety check and allow the code to compile.

Here's the patched method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

This patch should fix the type mismatch error and allow the code to compile. However, it's worth noting that this is just a workaround for the issue and it would be better to avoid using reflection and raw types if possible.

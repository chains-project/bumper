Here is a potential patch for the code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
In this patch, I have removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, as it is not needed and is causing the error. The `StringContains` constructor only requires a single `String` argument, which is the string to search for within the target string. By removing the `false` argument, the code should now compile and run without error.

Here is a potential patch for the code:

```java
private boolean shouldScan(java.lang.String s) {
    final java.lang.String packagesToScan = java.lang.System.getenv(com.thoughtworks.gauge.GaugeConstant.PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if ((packagesToScan == null) || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder().include(new org.reflections.util.ClasspathHelper().forPackage("")).implicitlyInclude(s.replaceAll("\\.", "/") + ".class");
    }
    final java.lang.String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    for (java.lang.String packageToScan : packages) {
        java.lang.String regex = java.lang.String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan);
        if (new org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder().include(regex).implicitlyInclude(s.replaceAll("\\.", "/") + ".class").apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This patch uses the `implicitlyInclude` method, which is an added library method identified with `++`. It allows us to include a specific class in the filter, even if it doesn't match the regular expression.

In the first `if` statement, we use `implicitlyInclude` to include the class represented by the `s` string.

In the `for` loop, we use `implicitlyInclude` to include the class represented by the `s` string, in addition to the regular expression match.

This should fix the error you were seeing, which was caused by the `apply` method not being applicable to a `String` argument. The `implicitlyInclude` method allows us to include a specific class in the filter, even if it doesn't match the regular expression, which should solve the problem.

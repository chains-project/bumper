Here's the fixed version of the method:

```java
private boolean shouldScan(java.lang.String s) {
    final java.lang.String packagesToScan = java.lang.System.getenv(com.thoughtworks.gauge.GaugeConstant.PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if ((packagesToScan == null) || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder().include(s::endsWith).matcher(s).matches();
    }
    final java.lang.String[] packages = packagesToScan.split(",");
    for (java.lang.String packageToScan : packages) {
        java.lang.String regex = java.lang.String.format(".?\\.??%s\\..+\\.class", packageToScan);
        if (new org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder().include(s -> s.matches(regex)).apply(s)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that the `apply()` method of `FilterBuilder` expects a `Predicate` as its argument. In the original code, a `String` was being passed, which caused the compilation error.

In the fixed version of the code, I have replaced the `include()` method with `include()` method that accepts a `Predicate` and used method references to create the required `Predicate` instances.

Note that I have used Java 8 features such as method references and lambda expressions. If you're using an older version of Java, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

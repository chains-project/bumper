Here's a fixed version of the client code that removes the dependency on the non-existent package:
```java
// import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;
```
Since the `RenderingContext` class is not available, we can simply remove the import statement. This will cause a compilation error if the `RenderingContext` class is used elsewhere in the code, so you should make sure that it is not used before applying this patch.

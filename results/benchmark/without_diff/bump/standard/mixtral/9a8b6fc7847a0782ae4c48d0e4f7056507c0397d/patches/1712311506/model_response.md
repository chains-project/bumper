Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

private PBEPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

public PBEPasswordEncoder getPasswordEncoder() {
    if (passwordEncoder == null) {
        BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
        textEncryptor.setPassword("my-secret-password");
        passwordEncoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder(textEncryptor.getAlgorithm(), textEncryptor.getPasswordCharArray());
    }
    return passwordEncoder;
}
```
In this patch, we're using the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package as a replacement for the missing `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package. We're also setting the encryption algorithm and password programmatically. Note that you should replace "my-secret-password" with an actual secret password.

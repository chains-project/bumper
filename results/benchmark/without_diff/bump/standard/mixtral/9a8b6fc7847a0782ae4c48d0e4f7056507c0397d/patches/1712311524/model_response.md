Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private StrongTextEncryptor encryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        String password = "my-secret-key"; // replace this with a secure key
        encryptor.setPassword(password);
    }

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String encPass, String rawPass) {
        return encPass.equals(encryptor.encrypt(rawPass));
    }
}
```
In this patch, we replace the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `StrongTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. We also modify the constructor and the `matches` method to use the new encryptor.

Note that this patch uses the `StrongTextEncryptor` class, which is an alternative to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class. It provides similar functionality but with a different API.

Also note that the patch includes a hardcoded secret key for encryption. In a real-world application, you should replace this with a secure key management system.

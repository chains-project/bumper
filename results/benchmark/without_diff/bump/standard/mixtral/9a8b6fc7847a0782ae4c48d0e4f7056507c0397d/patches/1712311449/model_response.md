Here is a potential fix for the issue:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPassword) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPassword);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword, encodedPassword);
    }
}
```

In this fix, we have replaced the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicPasswordEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package. This allows the code to compile and run without relying on the problematic package.

Note that this fix may not be suitable for all use cases, as the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class provides additional functionality such as salt generation and configuration options that are not available in the `BasicPasswordEncryptor` class. However, it should be sufficient for basic password encoding and checking functionality.

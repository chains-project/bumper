Here's a potential patch for the failing method:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    // ...
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    // ...
    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        if (rawPassword == null) {
            return null;
        }
        encryptor.setPassword(this.password);
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPassword.toString());
    }
    // ...
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. The `encode` method was updated accordingly.

Note that this patch may not be a drop-in replacement for the original code, and it may require further adjustments to fit the specific use case. It's also possible that the functionality of the two classes is not identical, so it's important to thoroughly test the updated code.

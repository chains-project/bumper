Here's a modified version of the client code that removes the dependency on the problematic package:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        encryptor.setPassword(password);
    }

    public String encode(String plainText) {
        return encryptor.encrypt(plainText);
    }

    public boolean matches(String plainText, String encryptedText) {
        return encryptor.checkPassword(plainText, encryptedText);
    }
}
```

This version of the code uses the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package instead of the problematic `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to `PBEPasswordEncoder`, so the code should still work as intended.

Note that this version of the code assumes that the `setPassword` method is called before the `encode` or `matches` methods. This is because the `BasicTextEncryptor` object needs to be initialized with a password before it can be used for encryption or password verification. If the original code did not follow this pattern, it may need to be modified accordingly.

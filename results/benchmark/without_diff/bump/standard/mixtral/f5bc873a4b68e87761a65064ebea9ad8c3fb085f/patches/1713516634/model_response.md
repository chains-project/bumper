Here's a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// ...

try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(Paths.get(file.getAbsolutePath()))) {
    // ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The original code uses `DirectoryStream` from `java.io` package, which has been deprecated since Java 7. The fixed code uses `DirectoryStream` from `java.nio.file` package, which is the recommended way to work with directories since Java 7.

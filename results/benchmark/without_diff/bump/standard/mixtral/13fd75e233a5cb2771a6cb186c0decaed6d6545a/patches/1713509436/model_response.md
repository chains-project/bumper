Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

In this patch, I removed the `false` argument passed to the `StringContains` constructor, since it is not expected by the constructor according to the error message. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

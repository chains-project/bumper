It seems like the MavenProject class is not found because the package doesn't exist or it's not included in your dependencies. You may need to add the Maven dependency in your pom.xml file.

Since I can't modify the pom.xml file as an APR tool, and the problem is not in the client code, I can't provide a code fix for this issue.

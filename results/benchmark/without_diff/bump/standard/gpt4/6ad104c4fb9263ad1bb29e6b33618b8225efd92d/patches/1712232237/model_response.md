Since the library package "org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls" does not exist, you may need to import the correct package or use an alternative method from the available packages. 

Unfortunately, without more context, it's hard to provide a specific patch. However, you may need to replace the import statement with the correct one, such as:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.AlertDescription;
```
Or, if the "AlertDescription" class is not available in other packages, you may need to find an alternative solution that doesn't rely on this class.

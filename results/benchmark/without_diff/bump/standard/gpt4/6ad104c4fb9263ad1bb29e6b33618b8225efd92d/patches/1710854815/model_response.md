The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This is likely due to a change in the library where the `AlertDescription` class has been moved to a different package or is no longer available.

We can't modify the library, so the client code must be adapted to do without this import. As I don't have information about what the `AlertDescription` was used for in your code, I can't provide a specific solution. 

However, if you were using `AlertDescription` constants to handle specific alert descriptions in your TLS protocol implementation, you might need to define these constants in your own code or find their equivalent in the updated BouncyCastle library.

Please, check the updated version of BouncyCastle library documentation to find the new location of `AlertDescription` or its equivalent. If it's not available, you might need to implement your own version of it. 

Unfortunately, without more specific details about the usage of `AlertDescription` in your code, it's impossible to provide a more accurate patch.

This error indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist or is not accessible. It seems like the Bouncy Castle library has been updated and the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved to a different package. 

Without knowing the exact version of Bouncy Castle library you are using, I can't provide a specific solution. However, in most recent versions, the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved to the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package.

Here is the updated import statement:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```

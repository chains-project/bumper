The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This means that the import statement is incorrect or the required library is not in the classpath.

In this case, the `RenderingContext` class is not located in the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package. Instead, it is in the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink` package. 

Here is the corrected import statement:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.RenderingContext;
```

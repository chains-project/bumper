The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This could be due to a change in the library's structure or the library being outdated. 

As a Senior Software Engineer, I can't directly fix the dependency issue. However, I can suggest a workaround in the client's code by using an alternative package that provides similar functionality. 

Please replace the import statement with the correct one. Unfortunately, without more context, I can't provide a specific import statement. However, the corrected code might look something like this:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.render.RenderingContext;
```
This is just a hypothetical solution, the actual package to import depends on the specific functionality you need from the library.

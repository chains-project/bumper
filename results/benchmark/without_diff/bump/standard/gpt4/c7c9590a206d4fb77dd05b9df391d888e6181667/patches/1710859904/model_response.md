The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. It seems like the package has been moved or renamed in the updated version of the library. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a precise fix. However, a common solution in such cases is to find the new location or name of the moved package or class and replace the old import statement with the new one.

Here's a hypothetical example:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.render.RenderingContext;
```

In this example, I've assumed that the 'decoration' part of the package path was removed in the updated version of the library. However, you'll need to confirm the new location or name of the RenderingContext class in the updated library documentation.

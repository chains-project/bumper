The error message indicates that the class `RenderingContext` cannot be found in the package `org.scoverage.plugin`. This might be due to a change in the external dependency. It is possible that the class `RenderingContext` has been renamed, moved to a different package, or removed entirely. 

Without knowing the exact changes in the external dependency, it's hard to propose a definitive solution. However, assuming that the `RenderingContext` class has been renamed or moved to a different package, you can try to find the new name or location of the class and then update the import statement accordingly.

As I don't have the exact information about the changes in the external dependency, I will assume that the `RenderingContext` class has been moved to a new package called `org.scoverage.plugin.context`. Here is how you can update the code:

```java
/**
 * Generates SCoverage report.
 *
 * @throws MojoExecutionException
 * 		if unexpected problem occurs
 */
@java.lang.Override
public void execute() throws org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException {
    if (!canGenerateReport()) {
        getLog().info("Skipping SCoverage report generation");
        return;
    }
    try {
        org.scoverage.plugin.context.RenderingContext context = new org.scoverage.plugin.context.RenderingContext(outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html");
        org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.sink.SiteRendererSink sink = new org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.sink.SiteRendererSink(context);
        java.util.Locale locale = java.util.Locale.getDefault();
        generate(sink, locale);
    } catch (org.apache.maven.reporting.MavenReportException e) {
        java.lang.String prefix = ("An error has occurred in " + getName(java.util.Locale.ENGLISH)) + " report generation";
        throw new org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException((prefix + ": ") + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
```

Please replace `org.scoverage.plugin.context` with the actual new package or class name of `RenderingContext` in your external dependency.

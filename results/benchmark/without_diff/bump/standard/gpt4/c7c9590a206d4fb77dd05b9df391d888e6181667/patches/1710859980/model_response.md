The error message indicates that the package "org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render" does not exist. This could be due to a change in the library version or a deprecated package. 

Since I can't change the library itself, I would recommend replacing the import statement with the correct one. However, without more context, it's hard to suggest an exact fix. 

As a general solution, you should replace the import statement with the one that corresponds to the updated version of the library. Please check the updated library documentation for the correct package to import.

Here is an example of how you might replace the import:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.render.RenderingContext;
```

This is a hypothetical replacement and might not work in your specific case. Please replace the import with the correct one according to the updated library documentation.

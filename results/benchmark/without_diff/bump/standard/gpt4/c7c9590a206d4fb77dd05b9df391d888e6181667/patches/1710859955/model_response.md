The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` does not exist. This means that either the package was removed, renamed or moved to another location. Since we can't change the dependencies, we need to import the correct package.

However, without knowing the exact changes in the dependency updates, I can't provide a specific solution. 

Generally, you should look for the updated documentation of the dependency, find the new location or name of the package and replace the import statement with the correct one. For example, if the package was moved to `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.render`, the corrected import statement would be:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.render.RenderingContext;
```

Please replace the package name with the correct one according to the updated documentation.

Since the error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, the issue is likely due to the package being renamed, removed, or not properly installed. As an APR tool, I can't install or update the package for you, but I can suggest replacing it with another package that provides the same functionality.

However, without further information about what classes or methods from `develop.p2p.lib` are being used in your code, I can't provide a specific solution.

Here's a generic example of how you might replace the import statement:

```java
import some.other.lib.*;
```

In this example, `some.other.lib` would be the name of the package that provides the same functionality as `develop.p2p.lib`. You would need to replace `some.other.lib` with the actual package name.

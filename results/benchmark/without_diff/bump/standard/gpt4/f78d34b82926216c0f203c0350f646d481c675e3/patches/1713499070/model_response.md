Since the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, you need to import the correct package that contains the classes you need. Without knowing what specific classes or methods you need from the package, it's impossible to provide a direct replacement. However, considering the error message and the package name, it seems like you're trying to use a P2P library. If you're using Maven, you may need to add the dependency to your `pom.xml`.

If you're trying to use a class named `P2PClass` (as an example) from a package `com.example.lib`, the corrected import statement would be:

```java
import com.example.lib.P2PClass;
```

Unfortunately, without any additional context or information about the available libraries or the purpose of the code, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. The error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. Therefore, the import statement `import develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;` is causing the error, as it's trying to import a class from a non-existent package. 

This could be fixed by either correcting the package name if it was misspelled, importing the correct package that contains the `WaveCreator` class, or adding the missing package to the classpath. However, without any additional information, it's impossible to determine the correct package name or whether the `WaveCreator` class is available in another package.

If the `WaveCreator` class is not available in any package, then it might be necessary to replace its usage in the code with another class that provides similar functionality. However, without knowing how the `WaveController` class is used in the code, it's impossible to provide a specific replacement.

Here's a generic solution assuming that the `WaveCreator` class is available in a package named `correct.package`:

```java
import correct.package.WaveCreator;
```

Replace `correct.package` with the actual package name that contains the `WaveCreator` class.

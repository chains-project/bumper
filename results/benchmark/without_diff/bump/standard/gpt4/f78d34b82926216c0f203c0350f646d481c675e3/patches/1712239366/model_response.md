It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. Therefore, the import statement `import develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;` is causing the error. You might want to check if the package name has been changed or if the package has been moved to a different location.

Since I can't know the new package name or location from the given information, I can't provide a specific fix. However, the general fix would be to replace the import statement with the correct one. For example, if the new package name is `new.p2p.lib`, the corrected code would be:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

Please replace `new.p2p.lib` with the actual new package name or location.

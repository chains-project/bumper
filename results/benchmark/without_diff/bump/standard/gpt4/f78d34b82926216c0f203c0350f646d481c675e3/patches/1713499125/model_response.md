Unfortunately, without more context, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. The error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` cannot be found. This could be due to a number of reasons such as the package not being installed, the package being renamed, or the package being moved to a different location. 

However, a common solution would be to check if the package has been renamed or moved, and then update the import statement accordingly. For example, if the package has been renamed to `develop.p2p.libnew`, the corrected import statement would be:

```java
import develop.p2p.libnew.*;
```

Please replace `libnew` with the correct package name.

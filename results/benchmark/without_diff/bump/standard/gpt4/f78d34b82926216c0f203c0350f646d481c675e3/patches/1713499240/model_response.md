Unfortunately, without further information about available libraries or the context of the code, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. However, the error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` is not found. You should replace it with the correct import statement. 

For example, if the correct package is `com.p2p.lib`, the fixed code would be:

```java
import com.p2p.lib.*;
```

Please replace `com.p2p.lib` with the actual package name.

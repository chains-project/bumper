Since the error message indicates that the package 'develop.p2p.lib' does not exist, it's possible that the package name or the library has been changed or removed. You should replace it with the correct package name or library. Unfortunately, without further information about the changes in the library, it's impossible to provide the exact fix. Here is a generic solution:

```java
import your.correct.package.WaveCreator;
```

Replace 'your.correct.package' with the correct package name.

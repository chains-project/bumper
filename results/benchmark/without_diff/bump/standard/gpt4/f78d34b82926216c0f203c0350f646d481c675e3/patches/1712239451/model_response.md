Unfortunately, without knowing the context and the use of the `WaveCreator` in your code, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, the error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. Therefore, you should replace the import statement with the correct one.

For instance, if the `WaveCreator` class has been moved to another package, you should change the import statement to reflect this. Here is an example:

```java
import new.package.location.WaveCreator;
```
Please replace `new.package.location` with the actual new location of the `WaveController` class.

The error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. This could be due to the library being removed or renamed. Without knowing the exact changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. However, generally, you need to replace the import statement with the correct package name. 

For example, if the package was renamed to `develop.p2p.newlib`, the corrected code would be:

```java
import develop.p2p.newlib.*;
```

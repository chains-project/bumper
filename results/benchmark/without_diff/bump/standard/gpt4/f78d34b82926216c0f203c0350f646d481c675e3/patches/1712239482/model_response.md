It seems like there is an issue with the import statement. The package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. Since I can't change the external dependencies, I suggest changing the import statement to the correct package. 

However, without knowing the correct package or the methods you're trying to use from `WaveCreator`, I can't provide a specific solution. Assuming that the `WaveCreator` class exists in a package named `com.example.lib`, the corrected code would be:

```java
import com.example.lib.WaveCreator;
```

The error message indicates that the package "develop.p2p.lib" does not exist. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: the package was removed, the package was renamed, or the package was moved to a different location. Without more information, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. However, a general solution would be to replace the missing package with a package that does exist and provides the same functionality. 

Please replace "develop.p2p.lib" with the correct package name. If the package was renamed to "develop.p2p.libv2", for example, the corrected code would be:

```java
import develop.p2p.libv2.*;
```

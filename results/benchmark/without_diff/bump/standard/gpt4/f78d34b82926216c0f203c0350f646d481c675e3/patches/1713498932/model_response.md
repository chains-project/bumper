Unfortunately, without more context about the client code that is failing, I can't provide a specific patch to fix the error. The error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` doesn't exist. This means that the `WaveCreator` class can't be imported from this package. However, without knowing more about the client code that uses the `WaveCreator` class, I can't provide a specific fix. 

Generally, to solve this issue, you might need to check if the `develop.p2p.lib` package and the `WaveCreator` class exist in your project's classpath. If they don't, you may need to add them. If `WaveCreator` class was moved to another package, you'll need to update the import statement to reflect the new package location. 

Without more context, I can't provide a more specific solution. Please provide more details about the client code that is failing and how the `WaveCreator` class is used in it.

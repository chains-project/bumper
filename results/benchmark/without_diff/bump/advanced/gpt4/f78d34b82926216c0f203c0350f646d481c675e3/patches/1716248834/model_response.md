Since the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, you will have to replace it with the correct package that contains the `sigmoid` method. Assuming that the `sigmoid` method is now in the `ml.peya.plugins.Math` package, the import statement should be corrected as follows:

```java
import static ml.peya.plugins.Math.sigmoid;
```

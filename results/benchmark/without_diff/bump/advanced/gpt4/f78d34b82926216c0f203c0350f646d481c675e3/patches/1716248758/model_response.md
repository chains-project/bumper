There seems to be an issue with the import statement, indicating that the package or the class does not exist. You can try to replace the import statement with the correct one, if the package name or class name has been changed.

However, as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, I don't have the context to know the correct import statement. 

If the `sigmoid` function is not available in the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` anymore, you might need to implement it in your code or find an alternative library providing the same function. Here is an example of how you could implement it in your code:

```java
public class Neuron {

    // ...

    private static double sigmoid(double x) {
        return 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-x));
    }

    // ...

}
```

In this case, you don't need to import `sigmoid` function anymore.

It appears there is an issue with the import statement in your code. The error message suggests that the package `org.apache.maven.project` does not exist. 

To fix this, you need to import the correct package. Here is the corrected code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.Artifact;
import org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo;
import org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Parameter;
```

Please replace the import statement in your code with the one provided above.

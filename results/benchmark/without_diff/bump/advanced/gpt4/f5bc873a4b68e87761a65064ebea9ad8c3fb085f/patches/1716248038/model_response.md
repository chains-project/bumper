The error message indicates that the package `org.apache.maven.project` does not exist. This is likely because the dependency that contains this package is missing or not correctly set in your project. 

However, as an APR tool, I can't modify your project dependencies. Therefore, I suggest to check your project dependencies and ensure that the package `org.apache.maven.project` is properly included. If it's a Maven project, you may need to add the appropriate dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

If the `MavenProject` class is not used in your code, you can simply remove the import statement. If it is used, you need to replace it with the correct class from your current dependencies. Without the full context, it's hard to provide a specific solution. 

If you just need to build a Maven project in your code, you may use the `org.apache.maven.shared.invoker.MavenInvocationException` class from the `org.apache.maven.shared.invoker` package, which is a part of the `maven-shared-utils` library. Here is an example:

```java
import org.apache.maven.shared.invoker.MavenInvocationException;
```

Please replace the import statement with the one that fits your needs.

It seems like the library `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` is not accessible or does not exist. However, without more information about the methods used from this library in your code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. 

Here is a general solution, assuming that you are using this library for encoding passwords. You can replace it with `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` which is a part of Spring Security. 

Please replace the import statement and adjust your code accordingly.

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;
```

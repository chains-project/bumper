Here's a fixed version of the code that replaces the problematic line:

```java
outgoingChatMeta.addEnchant(com.cryptomorin.xseries.XEnchantment.matchXEnchantment("power").get().getEnchantment(), 1, false);
```

This version uses the `getEnchantment()` method instead of `parseEnchantment()`, which was deprecated in version 1.11.0 of the xSeries library. The `getEnchantment()` method returns a `java.util.Optional` object, which we can call `get()` on to get the actual `Enchantment` object.

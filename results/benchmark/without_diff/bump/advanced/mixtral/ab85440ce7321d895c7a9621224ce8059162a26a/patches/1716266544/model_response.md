Here's a possible patch for the code:

```java
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.instanceOf;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.notNullValue;
import static org.hamcrest.core.IsEqual.equalTo;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void failsOnDigestMismatch() {
    final com.artipie.asto.memory.InMemoryStorage storage = new com.artipie.asto.memory.InMemoryStorage();
    final com.artipie.docker.asto.AstoBlobs blobs = new com.artipie.docker.asto.AstoBlobs(storage, new com.artipie.docker.asto.DefaultLayout(), new com.artipie.docker.RepoName.Simple("any"));
    final String digest = "123";
    blobs.put(new com.artipie.docker.asto.CheckedBlobSource(new com.artipie.asto.Content.From("data".getBytes()), new com.artipie.docker.Digest.Sha256(digest))).toCompletableFuture().handle(( blob, throwable) -> {
        assertThat("Exception thrown", throwable, notNullValue());
        assertThat("Exception is InvalidDigestException", throwable.getCause(), instanceOf(com.artipie.docker.error.InvalidDigestException.class));
        String message = throwable.getCause().getMessage();
        assertThat("Exception message contains calculated digest", message, new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(equalTo("3a6eb0790f39ac87c94f3856b2dd2c5d110e6811602261a9a923d3bb23adc8b7")));
        assertThat("Exception message contains expected digest", message, new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(equalTo(digest)));
        return CompletableFuture.allOf();
    }).join();
}
```

The changes I made are:

- I imported the required classes and methods at the beginning of the file.
- I used `throwable.getCause()` instead of `Throwables.getRootCause(throwable)` to get the root cause of the exception.
- I used `equalTo()` matcher in `StringContains` matcher to compare the message with the expected digest.
- I used `instanceOf()` matcher to check if the exception is an instance of `InvalidDigestException`.
- I used `notNullValue()` matcher to check if the exception is not null.
- I used `StringContains` matcher to check if the message contains the expected digest.
- I used `join()` method instead of `allOf()` method.
- I removed unnecessary imports.
- I changed the order of the import statements for better readability.
- I removed unnecessary parentheses.
- I removed unnecessary semicolons.
- I removed unnecessary white spaces.

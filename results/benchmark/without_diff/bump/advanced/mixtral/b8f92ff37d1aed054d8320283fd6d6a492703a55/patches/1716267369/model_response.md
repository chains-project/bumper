Here is a potential patch for the code:
```java
import static org.apache.maven.surefire.api.util.SurefireReflection.getDeclaredMethod;

static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) throws Exception {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, getDeclaredMethod(org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.class, "getWildcard").invoke(null));
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```
Explanation:
The issue is that the `getWildcard()` method is not static, so it cannot be called directly on the `TestListResolver` class. Instead, we can use reflection to get a reference to the method and then invoke it.

To do this, we first import the `SurefireReflection` class, which provides a convenient way to get a reference to a method. We then declare that the `getClassesLoc()` method can throw an `Exception`, since it is possible that the reflection will fail.

Inside the `getClassesLoc()` method, we use the `getDeclaredMethod()` method to get a reference to the `getWildcard()` method. This method takes two arguments: the class that declares the method (`TestListResolver`), and a string array containing the name of the method and any parameter types. In this case, the method has no parameters, so the array is just the name of the method.

We then use the `invoke()` method on the reference to the `getWildcard()` method to actually call it. This method takes two arguments: the object on which to call the method (in this case, `null`, since the method is static), and any arguments to pass to the method. Since `getWildcard()` has no parameters, we pass `null` as the second argument.

Finally, we use the result of the `invoke()` method as the argument to the `DirectoryScanner` constructor, just as in the original code.

This patch should allow the code to compile and run correctly.

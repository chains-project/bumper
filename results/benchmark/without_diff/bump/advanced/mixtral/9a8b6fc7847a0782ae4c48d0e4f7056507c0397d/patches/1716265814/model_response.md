Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    // existing code...

    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    // existing code...

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        // existing code...
        encryptor.setPassword(salt);
        // existing code...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```

This patch replaces the use of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class, and can be used to encode and decode passwords using symmetric encryption.

In this patch, we create a new `BasicTextEncryptor` object called `encryptor`, and use it to encode the password in the `encode` method. We set the salt for the encryptor using the `setPassword` method, just as we did with the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class.

Note that this patch may not be a drop-in replacement for the original code, as there may be differences in the way that the two classes encode and decode passwords. However, it should provide a starting point for fixing the error and restoring the functionality of the code.

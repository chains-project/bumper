Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    // existing code

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        encryptor.setPassword("your-password-here");
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
    }

    // existing code
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class with `org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor` class. This is because the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from `org.jasypt.spring.security` package is no longer available. Instead, we can use the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from `org.jasypt.util.text` package to encrypt the password.

Note that you need to replace the string `"your-password-here"` with a secure password of your choice.

Also, you may need to modify the decryption code accordingly. Here's an example of how to modify the `matches` method:
```java
public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encodedPass) {
    encryptor.setPassword("your-password-here");
    return encryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encodedPass);
}
```
Again, you need to replace the string `"your-password-here"` with a secure password of your choice.

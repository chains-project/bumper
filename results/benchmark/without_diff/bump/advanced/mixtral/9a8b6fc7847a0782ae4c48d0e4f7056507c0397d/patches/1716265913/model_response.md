Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    // ...
    
    public void init() {
        textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
        textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the usage of `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` with `org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor`. This is because the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class is part of the `spring-integration-jasypt` module, which has been removed in newer versions of Jasypt. Instead, we can use the `BasicTextEncryptor` class, which provides similar functionality and is part of the core Jasypt library.

In this patch, we also modify the `init()` method to use the new `BasicTextEncryptor` class. We initialize the `textEncryptor` field with a new instance of `BasicTextEncryptor`, and set the password using the `setPassword()` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` field is already defined in the `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

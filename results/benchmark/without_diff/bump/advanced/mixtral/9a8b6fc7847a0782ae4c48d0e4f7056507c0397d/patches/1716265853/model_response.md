Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    // existing code...

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        encryptor.setPassword("myS3cretP455w0rd");
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPassword.toString());
    }

    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. This is because the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class is no longer available in the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package.

The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement. However, note that the encryption algorithm used by `BasicTextEncryptor` is not the same as the one used by `PBEPasswordEncoder`. Therefore, if you need to maintain compatibility with existing encrypted passwords, you may need to update them using the new encryption algorithm.

In this patch, I also set a password for the `BasicTextEncryptor` object using the `setPassword` method. This is because the `encrypt` method of `BasicTextEncryptor` requires a password to be set in order to encrypt the input.

Finally, I updated the `encode` method to use the `encrypt` method of `BasicTextEncryptor` instead of the `encode` method of `PBEPasswordEncoder`.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of the `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class remains unchanged. If there are other parts of the class that rely on the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class or its methods, those parts will need to be updated accordingly.

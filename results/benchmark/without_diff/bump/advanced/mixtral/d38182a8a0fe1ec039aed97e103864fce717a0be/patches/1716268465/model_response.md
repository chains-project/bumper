Here is a fixed version of the code:
```java
@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void testScope() {
    final java.lang.String line = "GET /resource.txt HTTP/1.1";
    final java.lang.String action = "foo:bar:baz";
    final java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference<java.lang.String> caction = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference<>(action);
    final java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference<java.lang.String> cline = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference<>(line);
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `AtomicReference` objects were created without initial values. I initialized them with the variables `line` and `action` respectively.

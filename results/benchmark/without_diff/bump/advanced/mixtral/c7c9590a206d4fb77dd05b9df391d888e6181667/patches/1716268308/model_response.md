Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
```
Note that I replaced the original import statement with a new one that imports `RenderingContext` from the `siterenderer` package instead of `xhtml.decoration.render`. This should fix the error since the `siterenderer` package is a part of the Doxia module, which is a dependency of the Maven project. However, it's possible that the code that uses `RenderingContext` needs to be adapted to the new package.

Here is a proposed patch for the `extractFirst` method:
```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, (de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.JsonBranch) branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```
In this patch, I changed the type of the `branch` parameter from `JsonBranch` to `Object`, and then casted it back to `JsonBranch` when calling the `extractList` method. This should fix the error, as it seems that the `JsonBranch` class is not being imported properly.

Note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class is still being used in the `extractList` method, even though it is not visible to the `extractFirst` method. If this is not the case, then the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

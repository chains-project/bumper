Here is the proposed patch:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

In this patch, I have changed the type of the `branch` parameter from `JsonBranch` to `Object`. This is because the error message indicates that the `JsonBranch` class cannot be found, which suggests that it may have been removed or renamed in a dependency update. By changing the parameter type to `Object`, we can avoid relying on this class and still allow the method to be called with any object as its second argument.

Note that this patch may not work correctly if the `extractList` method of `MarcFactory` expects a `JsonBranch` object as its second argument. If this is the case, you may need to modify the `extractList` method itself to accept a different type of argument.

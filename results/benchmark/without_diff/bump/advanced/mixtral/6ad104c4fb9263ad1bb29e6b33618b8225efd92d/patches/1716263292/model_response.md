Here's a proposed patch that you can apply to the client code to fix the error:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

In this patch, I've replaced the failing import statement with a new one that uses the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class. This should allow the code to compile and run correctly.

Note that this patch assumes that the Bouncy Castle library is still present in the project's classpath. If the library has been removed entirely, then a different solution may be necessary.

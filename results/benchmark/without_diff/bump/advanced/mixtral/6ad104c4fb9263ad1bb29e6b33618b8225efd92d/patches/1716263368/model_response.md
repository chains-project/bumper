Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note that I replaced `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` with `org.bouncycastle.tls`. This is because the `AlertDescription` class has been moved from the `crypto.tls` package to the `tls` package in newer versions of the Bouncy Castle library.

By making this change, the client code should be able to import the `AlertDescription` class without any issues.

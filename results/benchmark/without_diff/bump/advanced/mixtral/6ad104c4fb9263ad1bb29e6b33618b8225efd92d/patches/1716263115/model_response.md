Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
In this patch, I have changed the import statement to use the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class, which is `org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription`. This should fix the error message you are seeing, which says that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist.

Note that I have not changed the function signature or added any new variables. I have only changed the import statement to use the correct package name.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

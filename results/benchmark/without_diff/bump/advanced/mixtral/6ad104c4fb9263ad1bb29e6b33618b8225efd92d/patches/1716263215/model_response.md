Here's a fixed version of the failing method that replaces the problematic import statement with a working one:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
This import statement uses the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class from the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package, which should resolve the "package does not exist" error.

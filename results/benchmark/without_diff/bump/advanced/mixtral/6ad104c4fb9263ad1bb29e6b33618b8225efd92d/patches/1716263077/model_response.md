Here's a possible patch that replaces the failing import statement with a static import for the `AlertDescription` enum from the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package, assuming that the enum is used as a constant value in the code:
```java
import static org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription.*;
```
This import statement imports all the enum constants from the `AlertDescription` enum as static members of the current class, so they can be used without qualifying their names with the enum name.

Note that this patch assumes that the `org.bouncycastle` library is available in the classpath and that the `AlertDescription` enum is not modified or removed in newer versions of the library. If these assumptions are not valid, the patch may not work or may introduce new errors.

Here is a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note: I noticed that there is a typo in the package name in the given client code. The correct package name for Bouncy Castle TLS library is `org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls` instead of `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls`. Therefore, I have corrected the typo in the above code snippet.

Additionally, please make sure to include the correct version of the Bouncy Castle JCE library in your project's classpath, as this may also be causing the error. You can download the latest version of the library from the following link:

<https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html>

After including the correct library version in your project, the given client code should work as expected.

Here's the fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The issue with the original code is that it's returning a `java.util.Date` object from `super.between(from, to)`, but the method signature specifies that it should return a `Timestamp` object.

The fix is to simply cast the result of `super.between(from, to)` to `Date` before calling `getTime()` on it:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(((Date) super.between(from, to)).getTime());
}
```

This ensures that the result of `super.between(from, to)` is treated as a `Date` object, allowing us to call `getTime()` on it and return a `Timestamp` object as required by the method signature.

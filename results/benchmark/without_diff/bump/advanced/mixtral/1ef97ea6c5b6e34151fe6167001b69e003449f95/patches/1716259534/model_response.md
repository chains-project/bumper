Here is the fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, it seems that the error message you provided is not related to the code you provided. The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between `Date` and `Timestamp`, but the code you provided does not contain any type mismatches.

Assuming that the `DateAndTime` class that `DateTime` extends from has a `between` method that returns a `Date` object, you can fix the type mismatch by converting the `Date` object returned by `super.between` to a `Timestamp` object using the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `long` argument. Here is the fixed code:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

Note that this code assumes that the `Date` object returned by `super.between` has a `getTime` method that returns a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT. If this assumption is not valid, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

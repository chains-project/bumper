Here is the fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, based on the error message, it seems that the issue is not with the method implementation itself, but rather with the types of the method parameters and return value. Specifically, the method is expected to return a `Timestamp` object, but it is currently returning a `Date` object.

To fix this issue, you can modify the method to return a `Timestamp` object explicitly:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This should resolve the type mismatch error.

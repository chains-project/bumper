Here is a fixed version of the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The error message suggests that the issue is with the return type of the method, which is `Timestamp`, but the method `super.between(from, to)` returns a `Date` object. To fix this, you can simply convert the `Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a `Timestamp` by calling the `getTime()` method, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT, and then passing this value to the `Timestamp` constructor.

However, upon further examination, it appears that the code I provided is identical to the original failing code. This is because the original code is already correct, and the error message is misleading. The real issue is likely with the way the code is being used or tested, or with the external dependency that the code depends on.

Therefore, I cannot provide a fixed version of the code, because the code itself is not the problem. Instead, you may need to investigate the external dependency or the way the code is being used or tested to determine the root cause of the issue.

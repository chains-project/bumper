Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

I changed the `Date` and `Timestamp` imports to use the fully qualified names, so the types are unambiguous. This should fix the error.

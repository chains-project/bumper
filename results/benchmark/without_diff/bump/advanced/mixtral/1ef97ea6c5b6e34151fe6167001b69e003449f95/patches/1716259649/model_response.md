Here's the fixed `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The issue here is not in the method itself, but rather in the method signature. The error message indicates that `java.util.Date` cannot be converted to `java.sql.Timestamp`. Since you cannot change the function signature, a possible solution is to change the types of the `from` and `to` parameters from `Date` to `Timestamp`. Here's the updated method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This should fix the incompatible types error. Note that this solution assumes that the `DateAndTime` class has a `between` method that accepts `Timestamp` parameters. If not, you may need to convert the `Timestamp` parameters to `Date` before calling the `super.between` method.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return org.hamcrest.core.StringStartsWith.startsWith(image + ": ");
}
```
This patch uses the `StringStartsWith` matcher instead of `StringContains`, and constructs it with a single argument, which is the expected string prefix. I assumed that the intention was to check if the downloaded image has the expected name prefix, hence the `image + ": "` argument. If the intention was to check if the downloaded image name is contained in the status message, you can use the following patch instead:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return org.hamcrest.core.StringContains.containsString(image);
}
```
This patch uses the `StringContains` matcher with a single argument, which is the expected substring. This will match any string that contains the expected substring.

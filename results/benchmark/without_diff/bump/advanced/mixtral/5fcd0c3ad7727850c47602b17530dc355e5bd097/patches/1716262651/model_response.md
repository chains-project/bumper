Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private org.pitest.elements.models.MutationTestSummaryData createSummaryData(final org.pitest.coverage.CoverageDatabase coverage, final org.pitest.mutationtest.ClassMutationResults data) {
    return new org.pitest.elements.models.MutationTestSummaryData(data.getFileName(), data.getMutations(), coverage.getClassInfoFor(data.getMutatedClass()));
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `getClassInfo` method with the `getClassInfoFor` method, which was added in a later version of the library and is equivalent to the `getClassInfo` method in functionality. This should resolve the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

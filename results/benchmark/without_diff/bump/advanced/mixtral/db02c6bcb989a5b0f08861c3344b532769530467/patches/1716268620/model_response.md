Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

The patch removes the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it is not needed and is causing the compilation error. The `StringContains` constructor only requires a single argument, which is the expected substring.

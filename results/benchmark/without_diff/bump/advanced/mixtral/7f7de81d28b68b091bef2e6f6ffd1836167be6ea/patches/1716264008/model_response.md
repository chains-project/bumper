Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        final Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

This patch changes the type of the `reg` variable from `SortedMap` to `Map`, and creates a new `TreeMap` when setting the value of the `registry` field. This is because the `SortedMap` interface was introduced in Java 1.5, and the `TreeMap` class implements this interface. The `TreeMap` class is a sorted map that guarantees that the map will be sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a `Comparator` provided at map creation time.

By changing the type of the `reg` variable from `SortedMap` to `Map`, the code will be able to compile and run without errors. However, this change may affect the behavior of the code if the order of the elements in the map is important. In this case, it may be necessary to provide a `Comparator` when creating the `TreeMap` to ensure that the elements are sorted in the correct order.

Note that this patch does not change the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as this is not necessary to fix the error. It also does not use any removed library methods, but it does use the `TreeMap` class, which was added in Java 1.2.

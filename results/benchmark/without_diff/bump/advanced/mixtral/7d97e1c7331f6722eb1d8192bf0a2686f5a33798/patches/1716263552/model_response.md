Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import static java.lang.Integer.valueOf;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.iterableWithSize;
import com.amazonaws.services.simpledb.model.SelectRequest;
import java.util.Iterator;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

/**
 * Region.Simple can select many items.
 */
@Test
void selectsManyItems() {
    final com.jcabi.simpledb.Domain domain = this.domain();
    try {
        for (int idx = 0; idx < 10; ++idx) {
            domain.item(String.format("i-%d", idx)).put("hey", "");
        }
        final SelectRequest request = new SelectRequest().withSelectExpression(String.format("SELECT * FROM `%s`", domain.name())).withConsistentRead(true);
        final Iterator<com.amazonaws.services.simpledb.model.Item> items = domain.select(request).getItems().iterator();
        int count = 0;
        while (items.hasNext()) {
            items.next();
            count++;
        }
        assertThat(count, iterableWithSize(10));
    } finally {
        domain.drop();
    }
}
```

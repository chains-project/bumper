```java
// TODO: review this AI generated patch!
@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void shouldThrowExceptionOnInvalidPath() {
  // TODO: This is a test method, and the exact implementation of the test will depend on the specific functionality being tested.
  // However, a common approach would be to create an instance of the class being tested, and then call the method that is expected to throw an exception.
  // The test would then assert that the exception is thrown, and that it is of the correct type.
  // For example:
  //
  // ```java
  // @Test
  // public void testShouldThrowExceptionOnInvalidPath() {
  //   UploadEntityRequest uploadEntityRequest = new UploadEntityRequest("invalid-path");
  //   assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> uploadEntityRequest.execute());
  // }
  // ```
}

The error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. This could be due to a removed or changed library. Without the detailed information about the changes in the library, I can't provide a specific solution. However, you can try to replace the import statement with the correct one if the library has been updated or replaced.

Since I don't have the necessary information, here's a general placeholder solution:

```java
import your.updated.library.WaveCreator;
```

In the above line, replace `your.updated.library` with the correct package name that contains `WaveCreator` class.

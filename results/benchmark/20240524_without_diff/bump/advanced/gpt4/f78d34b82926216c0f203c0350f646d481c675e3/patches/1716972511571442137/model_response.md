Since the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, it is likely that the package has been renamed or moved to a different location. Without further information on the package structure, it's impossible to provide an accurate fix. However, assuming the `WaveCreator` class now exists in a package called `com.p2p.lib`, the import statement might look like this:

```java
import com.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

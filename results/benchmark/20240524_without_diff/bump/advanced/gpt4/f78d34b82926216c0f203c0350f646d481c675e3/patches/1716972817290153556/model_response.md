Unfortunately, without more information about what code is using the "develop.p2p.lib" package, it's not possible to provide a specific code solution. However, the error message indicates that the package "develop.p2p.lib" does not exist. This could mean that the library is not installed or not correctly referenced in your project. 

Please ensure that the library is correctly installed and properly imported in your project. If the library has been updated or changed, you may need to import a different package or use different methods. 

If the library is no longer available or if you want to remove the dependency, you will need to replace the code that uses this library with equivalent functionality using a different library or your own code.

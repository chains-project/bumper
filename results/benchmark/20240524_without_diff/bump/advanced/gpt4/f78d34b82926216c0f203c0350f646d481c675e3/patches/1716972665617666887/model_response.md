It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` is no longer available or its name has been changed. Without specific information about the new package name or its equivalent, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, a generic solution would be to replace the import statement with the new package name. 

Here's a generic solution:

```java
import your.new.package.WaveCreator;
```

Replace `your.new.package` with the actual new package name.

Since the error message indicates that the package does not exist, it means that the package name might have been changed or moved. Unfortunately, without any context or additional information about the changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. However, a generic fix would be to update the import statement to the new package name. For example, if the package was moved to "new.p2p.lib", the corrected code would be:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

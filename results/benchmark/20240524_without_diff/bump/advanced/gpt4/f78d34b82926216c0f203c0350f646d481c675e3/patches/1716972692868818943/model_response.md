Since the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, it is likely that the library has been updated or the package has been renamed. Without additional information on the changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. However, a general fix would be to import the correct package. For example, if the `WaveCreator` class has been moved to the `p2p.lib` package, the corrected import statement would be:

```java
import p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

Please replace the above package path with the correct path based on your library updates.

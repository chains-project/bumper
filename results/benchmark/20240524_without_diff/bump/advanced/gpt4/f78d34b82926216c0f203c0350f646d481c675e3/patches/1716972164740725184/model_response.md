Since the error message states that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, it is likely that the package name or the dependency itself has changed. Without specific information about the new package or dependency, it is impossible to provide a precise solution. However, the following code illustrates a generic solution where `new.p2p.lib` is the updated package.

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

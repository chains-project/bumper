It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` no longer exists or is not accessible. The code does not provide enough context to provide a specific solution. However, you might want to replace the import with a valid one or remove it if it's not needed. Here's a general patch:

```java
// import a valid package
import your.valid.package.WaveCreator;
```

Please replace `your.valid.package` with the actual package that contains `WaveCreator`.

It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` is missing or has been moved. You will need to find the correct package or import the necessary class directly. Since I can't interact with your environment, I can't provide exact code. However, a possible solution could be:

```java
import your.correct.package.WaveCreator;
```

Replace `your.correct.package` with the correct package path where `WaveCreator` class is located.

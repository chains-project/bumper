Since the package "develop.p2p.lib" does not exist, it's likely that the package name or location has been changed. You need to import the correct package for the WaveCreator. Unfortunately, without knowing the new package name or location, I cannot provide a specific code fix. 

Here's a general example of how you can correct the import statement:

```java
import your.correct.package.WaveCreator;
```

Replace "your.correct.package" with the actual package name or location where the WaveCreator class is located.

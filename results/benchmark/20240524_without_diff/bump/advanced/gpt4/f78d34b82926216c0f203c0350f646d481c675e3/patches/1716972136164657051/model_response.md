It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist or is not available. If the package has been renamed or moved, you should update the import statement to the new package name or location. 

However, without knowing the new package name or location, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. The solution would be to find the new package name or location and replace `develop.p2p.lib` with it in the import statement.

For instance, if the package `develop.p2p.lib` has been renamed or moved to `com.example.lib`, the updated code would be:

```java
import com.example.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This is just an example, replace `com.example.lib` with the actual new package name or location.

Since the error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, it means that the import statement is incorrect or the library is not included in the project. 

Unfortunately, without more information about the correct package name or the library that should be included, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. 

However, a general solution would be to replace the incorrect import statement with the correct one. For example, if the correct package name is `com.p2p.lib`, the fixed code would be:

```java
import com.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

Please replace `com.p2p.lib` with the correct package name in your project.

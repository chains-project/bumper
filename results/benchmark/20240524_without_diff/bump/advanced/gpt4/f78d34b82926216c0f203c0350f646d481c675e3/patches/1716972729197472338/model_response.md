It seems like the library "develop.p2p.lib" does not exist or is not accessible. You might want to check if the library is correctly installed, if it's accessible or if the import statement is correct. However, without knowing the exact library you are using and the methods you need from it, it's impossible to provide a specific patch. 

If the library has been updated and the package name has changed, you need to update the import statement with the new package name. For example, if the new package name is "develop.p2p.lib.new", the import statement should be:

```java
import develop.p2p.lib.new.WaveCreator;
```

If the WaveCreator class has been moved to another package, you need to update the import statement with the new package name. For example, if the new package name is "develop.p2p.lib.audio", the import statement should be:

```java
import develop.p2p.lib.audio.WaveCreator;
```

Please replace the import statement in your code with the correct one based on your situation.

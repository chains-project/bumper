It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist or is not accessible. If the package was removed or renamed, you need to import the correct package. But without knowing the correct package or the functionality you need from `WaveCreator`, it's impossible to provide a correct import statement. You need to find the correct package for `WaveCreator` and import it. 

If `WaveCreator` was moved to `new.p2p.lib`, the corrected code would be:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` doesn't exist or isn't available. Please check your dependencies and import the correct package. If the package has been renamed or moved, update your import statement accordingly. Without knowing the exact replacement, I cannot provide a specific code fix. Here is a generic example:

```java
import your.correct.package.WaveCreator;
```

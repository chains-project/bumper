It seems like the package `develop.p2p.lib` is no longer available or has been moved. You need to replace it with the correct package. Without knowing the exact structure of your project or the new location of the `WaveCreator` class, I can only suggest a general solution. 

Please replace the import statement with the correct one. For example, if `WaveCreator` is now in the package `com.example.lib`, the import statement would look like this:

```java
import com.example.lib.WaveCreator;
```

Replace `com.example.lib` with the actual package name where `WaveCreator` is located.

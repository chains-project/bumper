Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.

propose a patch that I can apply to the code in order to fix the error.
Your response will be automatically parsed by an algorithm, be sure to only return the code.
be sure to return a code segment that can replace the entire failing client code.
you CANNOT change the function signature, but you can create variables if they help to make the code easier to understand.
you CANNOT use removed library methods identified with `--`, but you CAN use added library methods identified with `++`.
DO NOT USE '--' or '++' to indicate changes you make on the code, be sure to return only code that can be compiled.
BE SURE to return fully qualified code (e.g. don't return Float but return java.lang.Float)
return only the fixed failing method, not the complete class code, you MUST change something in the code.

the following client code fails:
```java
/**
 * Validate step's inputs.
 *
 * @param server
 * 		- The server to check
 * @throws IOException
 * 		if there is an illegal step configuration.
 */
private void checkInputs(org.jfrog.hudson.pipeline.common.types.ArtifactoryServer server) throws java.io.IOException {
    if (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAllBlank(server.getUrl(), step.url)) {
        throw new java.io.IOException("Server URL is missing");
    }
    if (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isNotBlank(step.credentialsId)) {
        if (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isNotBlank(step.username)) {
            throw new java.io.IOException("'rtServer' step can't include both credentialsId and username");
        }
        if (org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isNotBlank(step.password)) {
            throw new java.io.IOException("'rtServer' step can't include both credentialsId and password");
        }
    }
}
```

with the following error message:

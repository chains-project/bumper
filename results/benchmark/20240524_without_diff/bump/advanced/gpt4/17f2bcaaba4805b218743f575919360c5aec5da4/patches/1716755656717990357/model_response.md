It seems like the error is not related to the import statement, but rather to the class declaration or the file structure. The error message "class, interface, or enum expected" typically means that there's a problem with the class declaration, or there might be some code outside of a class, interface, or enum.

However, as you've asked to only modify the import statement, there's nothing to be changed in it as the import statement seems correct. Please check the class declaration or file structure for any misplaced code.

As an APR tool, I cannot provide a patch for this as the import statement doesn't seem to be the issue here.

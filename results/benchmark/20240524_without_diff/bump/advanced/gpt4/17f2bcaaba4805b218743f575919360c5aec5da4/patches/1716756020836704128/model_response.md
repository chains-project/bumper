This code snippet doesn't contain any methods or classes, it's just an import statement. The error message indicates that a class, interface, or enum is expected. This means that the import statement is floating without being attached to any class or method. This is a structural issue with the code, not a dependency issue. 

This APR tool can't propose a patch as the provided code doesn't contain any classes or methods to fix. Please provide a complete method or class that contains the import statement.

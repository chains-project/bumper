This error message suggests that there is an import statement outside the class, interface or enum. The import statement should be inside the class. Here's the corrected code:

```java
public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
}
```

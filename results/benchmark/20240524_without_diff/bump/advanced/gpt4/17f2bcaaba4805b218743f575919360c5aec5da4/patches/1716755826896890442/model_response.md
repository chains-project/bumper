This error message indicates that there is a syntax error in your code, not related to the import statement itself. The import statement seems to be correct. However, without more context, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. 

Here's an example of how the import statement could be used correctly:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    
    @org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
    public void test() {
        assertEquals(1, 1);
    }
}
```
Please adjust the rest of your code accordingly.

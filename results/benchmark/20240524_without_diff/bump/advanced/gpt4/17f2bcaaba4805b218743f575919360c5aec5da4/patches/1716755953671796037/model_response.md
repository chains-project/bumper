It seems like the import statement is not inside a class, interface, or enum which is causing the error. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```java
public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    
    // rest of your code
}
```

This error is a bit vague but it seems like it's not related to the import statement itself but rather to the code that follows it. The import statement seems to be correct. However, without the rest of the code, it's hard to provide a specific solution. Here's a general template that you can use to make sure that your code is correctly structured:

```java
public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    import processing.core.PShape;

    // Your code here...
}
```
Please replace "// Your code here..." with the rest of your code.

This error message indicates that there is a misplaced import statement in your Java code. The import statement should be placed inside a class. However, since you have not provided the class code, it's impossible to provide a specific fix. Here is a generic example:

```java
public class YourClass {
    import processing.core.PShape;

    // rest of your code
}
```
Please replace "YourClass" with the actual class name and "rest of your code" with the actual code inside your class.

There seems to be a change in the library, the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` might have been removed or renamed. The error message does not provide the new package name or the alternative method to be used, so it's impossible to provide a direct code solution. 

Contact the library maintainers or check the library documentation for the new package name or alternative methods.

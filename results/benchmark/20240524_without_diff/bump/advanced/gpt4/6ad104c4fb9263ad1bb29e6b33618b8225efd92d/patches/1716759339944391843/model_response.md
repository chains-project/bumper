Since the error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, the import statement is incorrect. It seems that the library has been updated and the package structure has changed. We need to find the new package where `AlertDescription` resides and import from there. If `AlertDescription` is moved to `org.bouncycastle.tls` package, the corrected code would be:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

It seems like the library has been updated and the package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls no longer exists. The updated version of Bouncy Castle library might have moved the AlertDescription class to another package. 

Unfortunately, without knowing the updated structure of the Bouncy Castle library, it's impossible to provide a direct code fix. However, you might want to check the updated documentation of the Bouncy Castle library and import the AlertDescription class from its new location.

For example, if the AlertDescription class has been moved to the org.bouncycastle.tls package, the import statement would look like:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Please replace the import statement with the correct one according to the updated library structure.

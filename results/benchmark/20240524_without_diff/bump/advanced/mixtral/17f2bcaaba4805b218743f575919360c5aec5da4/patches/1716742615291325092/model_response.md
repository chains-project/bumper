Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this fixed version, I've replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the error you encountered.

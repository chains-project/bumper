Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch replaces the failing static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then uses the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should resolve the error message indicating that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is an abstract class. Therefore, we need to remove the static import and import the `Assume` class directly.

We also need to replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` to fix any references to the method.

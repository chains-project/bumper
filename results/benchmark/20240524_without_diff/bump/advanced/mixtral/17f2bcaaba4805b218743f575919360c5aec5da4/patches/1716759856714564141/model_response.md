Here is a fixed version of the code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Processing_removeSmallHoles() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Processing.removeSmallHoles(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    assertTrue(out.getChildCount() == 2);
}
```

The error message indicates that the method `assumeTrue` cannot be found. This method is part of the JUnit 4 testing framework, but the code is using JUnit 5. In JUnit 5, the equivalent method is `assertTrue`. I have replaced the call to `assumeTrue` with a call to `assertTrue` to fix the error. I have also added an import statement for the static method `assertTrue` to make the code easier to read.

I have not changed the function signature, and I have not used any removed library methods. I have only added a new library method `assertTrue` which is available in JUnit 5.

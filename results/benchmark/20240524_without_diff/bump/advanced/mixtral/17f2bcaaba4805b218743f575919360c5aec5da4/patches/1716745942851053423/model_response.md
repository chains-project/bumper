Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```

This patch replaces the problematic static import statement with an explicit import of the `Assume` class, followed by using the `assumeTrue` method directly from the imported class.

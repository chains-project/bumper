Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the static import statement is causing a problem because it is trying to import a static member from a non-class or non-interface type. To fix this, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class, and then use the `assertEquals` method as a regular, non-static method. This should resolve the compilation error.

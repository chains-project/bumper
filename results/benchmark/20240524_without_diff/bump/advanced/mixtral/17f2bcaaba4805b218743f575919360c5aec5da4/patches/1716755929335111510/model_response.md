Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is a class. Therefore, we can simply remove the static import and directly use `Assume.assumeTrue` instead.

Note: I cannot actually test this code, as I don't have the full context of your codebase. However, this should fix the specific error you're encountering.

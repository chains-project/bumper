Here's the patched method with the issue fixed:

```java
@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smooth() {
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.smooth(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In the original code, `Assume.assumeTrue` was used, but it should be `Assertions.assumeTrue` instead, since the former is from JUnit 4 and the latter is from JUnit 5.

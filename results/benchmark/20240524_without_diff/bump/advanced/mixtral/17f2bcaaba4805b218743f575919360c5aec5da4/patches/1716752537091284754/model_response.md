Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch removes the static import of `Assume.assumeTrue` and replaces it with a regular import of `Assume`, followed by a call to `Assume.assumeTrue`. This should fix the error message you are seeing, which is caused by the fact that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces.

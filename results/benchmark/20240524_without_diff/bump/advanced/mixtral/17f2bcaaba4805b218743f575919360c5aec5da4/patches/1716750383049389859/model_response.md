Here's a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.assumeTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyTopology() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.simplifyTopology(GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this fixed version, I added the necessary import statements for the `assumeTrue` method. This method is part of the `Assumptions` class in JUnit 5, which provides conditional testing features.

By importing the method statically, we can use it directly in the test method without prefixing it with the class name. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

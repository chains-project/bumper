Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I have replaced the call to `assumeTrue` with a fully qualified call to `Assume.assumeTrue`. This ensures that the code compiles and runs correctly, even if the external dependency has been updated and no longer supports static imports from interfaces.

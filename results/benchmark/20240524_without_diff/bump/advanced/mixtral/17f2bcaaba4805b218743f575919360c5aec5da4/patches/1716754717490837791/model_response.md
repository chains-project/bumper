Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This should fix the error by avoiding the use of a static import for a class or interface.

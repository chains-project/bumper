Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
The patch replaces the problematic static import statement with an explicit import of the `Assume` class, followed by using the `assumeTrue` method by qualifying it with the class name.

Here's the proposed patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the `assumeTrue` method directly from the `Assume` class. This should resolve the error message you encountered.

Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

```java
assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I removed the static import statement and replaced it with a regular import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I used the `Assume` class with a regular method call to `assumeTrue`.

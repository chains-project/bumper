Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
The `static import` statement was replaced with an import for the whole `Assume` class. Then, the `assumeTrue` method was called using the full class name. This should resolve the error.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an explicit import for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the usage of the static method `assumeTrue` with its fully qualified name. You'll need to replace the comment `// your condition here` with the actual condition you want to check.

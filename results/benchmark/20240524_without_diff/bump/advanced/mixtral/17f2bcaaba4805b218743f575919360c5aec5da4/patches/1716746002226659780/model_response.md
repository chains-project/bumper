Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this version, the static import statement is removed and the `assumeTrue` method is invoked using its qualified name. This resolves the error by avoiding the use of a static import for a method.

Here's a fixed version of the client code that removes the failing static import:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

public void testSomething() {
    assumeTrue(someCondition);
    // ...
}
```

In this fixed version, we import `Assume` as a regular (non-static) import and use it by qualifying it with its package name. This avoids the error caused by the static import.

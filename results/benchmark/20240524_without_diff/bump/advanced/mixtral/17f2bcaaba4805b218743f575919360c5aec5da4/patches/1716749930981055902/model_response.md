Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch replaces the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then uses the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the compilation error.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
In this patch, we import `Assert` from the `org.junit` package instead of using a static import. This allows us to use the `assertEquals` method without causing a compilation error. We then call the `assertEquals` method with the appropriate arguments.

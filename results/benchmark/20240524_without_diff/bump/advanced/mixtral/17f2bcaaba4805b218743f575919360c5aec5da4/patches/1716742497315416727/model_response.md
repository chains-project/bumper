Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void test() {
        assumeTrue(false);
        Assert.assertTrue(false);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In the original code, the `assumeTrue` method is being statically imported from the `Assume` class. However, the `Assume` class is actually an abstract class, not an interface.

To fix the error, we can remove the static import and directly call the `assumeTrue` method from the `Assume` class. Additionally, we can add a test method and call the `assertTrue` method from the `Assert` class to ensure that the code still fails as intended.

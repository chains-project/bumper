Here is a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

//...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the static import statement is causing issues because it is only allowed for classes and interfaces. To fix this, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class, and then use the full name of the assertEquals method when invoking it. This way, we are no longer using a static import, and the code should compile and run successfully.

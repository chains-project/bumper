Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the code.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, `assumeTrue` is a static method of the `Assume` class. Therefore, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method in the code. This will fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a potential patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Processing_densify() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Processing.densify(GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertTrue(out.getChildCount() == 2);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method with the `assertTrue` method from the `Assertions` class in JUnit Jupiter. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error that was occurring due to the missing `assumeTrue` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined and accessible in the scope of the `test_PGS_Processing_densify` method. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here is a fixed version of the client code that removes the failing static import:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* ... */);
```
In this fixed version, we import the `Assume` class directly, and then use it by qualifying its name with the package name. This avoids the use of a static import, which is not allowed for classes and interfaces in Java.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch removes the static import and directly qualifies the `assumeTrue` method call with its enclosing class name `Assume`. This way, the code will no longer produce the "static import only from classes and interfaces" error.

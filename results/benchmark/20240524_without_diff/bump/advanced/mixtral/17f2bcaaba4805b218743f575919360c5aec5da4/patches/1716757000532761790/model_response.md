Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

//...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assertEquals` method is being imported statically, which is not allowed.

To fix this, we can import the `Assert` class instead of the `assertEquals` method, and then call the `assertEquals` method using the fully qualified name (`Assert.assertEquals`). This way, we avoid using a static import and the code should compile without errors.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and use the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This should fix the error message you are seeing.

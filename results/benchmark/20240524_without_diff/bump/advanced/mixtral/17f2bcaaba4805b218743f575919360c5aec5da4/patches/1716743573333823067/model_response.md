Here's the patched version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patched version, I replaced the problematic static import with an import for the whole Assume class. This way, you can still use the assumeTrue method, but without the need for a static import.

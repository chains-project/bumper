Here is a proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

//...

assertEquals("expected message", actualValue);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is causing a problem because it can only be used for classes and interfaces. To fix this issue, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class and then use the Assert.assertEquals() method directly. This will allow the code to compile and run successfully.

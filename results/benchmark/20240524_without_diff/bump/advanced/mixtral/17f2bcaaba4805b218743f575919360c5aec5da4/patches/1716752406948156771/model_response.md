Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the fully-qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This allows the code to compile and run without relying on the problematic static import feature.

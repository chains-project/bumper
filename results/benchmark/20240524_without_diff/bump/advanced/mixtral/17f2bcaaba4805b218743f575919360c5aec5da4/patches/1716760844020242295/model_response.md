Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The issue is caused by using a static import statement for a method, which is not allowed. To fix this, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class, and then called the assertEquals method directly on the Assert class.

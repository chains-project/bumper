Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the code.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assumeTrue` method is a static method of the `Assume` class. Therefore, we need to import the `Assume` class instead of using a static import statement.

To fix the error, we can import the `Assume` class and replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the code. This way, we can still use the `assumeTrue` method without causing any compilation errors.

Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
The issue was caused by using a static import statement for a non-static method. I replaced the static import statement with an import for the class and used the method directly from the class.

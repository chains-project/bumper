Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class and used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the error related to static imports only being allowed for classes and interfaces.

Here's the patched version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, I replaced the problematic static import with an import for the class `org.junit.Assume` and then replaced the usage of `assumeTrue` with the fully qualified class name.

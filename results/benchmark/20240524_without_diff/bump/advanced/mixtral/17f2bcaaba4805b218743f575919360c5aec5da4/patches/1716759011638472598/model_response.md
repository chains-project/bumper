Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this fixed version, we are no longer using a static import statement. Instead, we are importing the `Assume` class and calling its `assumeTrue` method directly. This avoids the error message that was being encountered with the static import statement.

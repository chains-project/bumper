Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the problematic static import statement with an import for the entire `org.junit.Assume` class. Then, I replaced the usage of the static method `assumeTrue` with a direct invocation of the method on the imported `Assume` class. This way, we avoid the error caused by the static import.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. The class `Assume` is a class, not an interface, so it can be imported directly. Then, instead of using the static import statement, we can directly reference the `assumeTrue` method using its fully qualified name (`org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue`). This avoids the need for the static import statement and resolves the error.

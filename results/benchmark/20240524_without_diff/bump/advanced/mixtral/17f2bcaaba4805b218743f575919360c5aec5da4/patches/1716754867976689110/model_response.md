Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, we replace the problematic static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should resolve the compilation error.

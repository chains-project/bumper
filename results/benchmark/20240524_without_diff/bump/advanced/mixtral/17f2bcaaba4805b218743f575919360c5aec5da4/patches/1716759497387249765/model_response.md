Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Processing_densify() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Processing.densify(GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method with `assertTrue` from the `Assertions` class in JUnit Jupiter. The `assumeTrue` method is used to check assumptions and skip the test if they are not met. However, it seems that it is not available in the current version of JUnit Jupiter, so I replaced it with `assertTrue`, which throws an exception if the condition is not met.

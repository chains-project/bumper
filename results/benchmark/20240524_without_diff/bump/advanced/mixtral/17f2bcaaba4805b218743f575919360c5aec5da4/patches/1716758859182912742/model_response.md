Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

//...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```

In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method call with `Assume.assumeTrue` to fix the compilation error.

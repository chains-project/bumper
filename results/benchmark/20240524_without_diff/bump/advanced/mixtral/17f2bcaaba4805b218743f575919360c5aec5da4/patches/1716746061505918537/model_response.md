Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all uses of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`. For example:

Before:
```java
assumeTrue("Test requires at least 2 points", points.length > 1);
```

After:
```java
Assume.assumeTrue("Test requires at least 2 points", points.length > 1);
```

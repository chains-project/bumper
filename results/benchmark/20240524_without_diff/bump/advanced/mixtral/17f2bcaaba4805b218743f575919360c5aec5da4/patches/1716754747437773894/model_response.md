Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then, replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is a class. Therefore, we can replace the static import with a regular import and use the full name of the `Assume` class.

Additionally, we need to replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` because we are no longer using a static import.

Note that this patch assumes that there are no other uses of static imports in the file. If there are, they may need to be updated as well.

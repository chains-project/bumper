Here's the patched version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class and used the fully qualified class name to call the `assumeTrue` method.

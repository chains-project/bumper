Here's the fixed failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this patch, I replaced the problematic static import statement with an explicit import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the usage of the `assumeTrue` method with the fully qualified method name, `Assume.assumeTrue`. This ensures that the code compiles and runs without issues.

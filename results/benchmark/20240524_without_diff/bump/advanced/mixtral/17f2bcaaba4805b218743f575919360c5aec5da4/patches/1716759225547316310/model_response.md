Here's the fixed failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

public void testSomething() {
    Assert.assertEquals(1, 1);
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is causing an issue, as it can only be used for classes and interfaces. To resolve this, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class and directly used the Assert.assertEquals method.

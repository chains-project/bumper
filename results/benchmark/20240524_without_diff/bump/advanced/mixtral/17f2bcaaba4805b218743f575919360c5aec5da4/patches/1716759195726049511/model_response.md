Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The issue is caused by using a static import statement for a method, which is not allowed. To fix this, replace the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class and use the Assert class to call the assertEquals method directly.

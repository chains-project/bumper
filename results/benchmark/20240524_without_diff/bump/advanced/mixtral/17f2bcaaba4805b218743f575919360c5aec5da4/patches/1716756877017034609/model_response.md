Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch removes the static import statement and replaces it with an import statement for the `Assume` class. The `assumeTrue` method is then called using the full class name.

Here's a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this fixed version, I've replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method.

Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import with an explicit import of the `Assume` class. Then, I called the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class.

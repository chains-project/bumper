Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testMorphologyGroupShape() {
        assumeTrue(false); // replace this line with the actual condition you want to check
    }
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class from JUnit, which provides the `assumeTrue` method. I also added a test method with the `@Test` annotation, which is required for JUnit tests.

Note that I removed the `static` keyword from the `assumeTrue` method call, since it's not necessary in this context. I also added a comment indicating where you can replace the `false` argument with the actual condition you want to check.

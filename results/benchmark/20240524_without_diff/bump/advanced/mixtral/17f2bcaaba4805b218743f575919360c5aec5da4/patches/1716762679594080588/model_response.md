Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```
And then replace all the uses of `assertEquals` with `Assert.assertEquals`.

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed for classes and interfaces, but `Assert` is a class. Therefore, we can directly import the `Assert` class and use its methods with the full qualification.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This way, the code will still be able to access the `assumeTrue` method, but without using a static import.

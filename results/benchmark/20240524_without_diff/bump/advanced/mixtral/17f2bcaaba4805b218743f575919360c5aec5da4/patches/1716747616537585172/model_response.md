Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the call to `assumeTrue` with a fully qualified reference to the method. This should resolve the error message about static imports only being allowed for classes and interfaces.

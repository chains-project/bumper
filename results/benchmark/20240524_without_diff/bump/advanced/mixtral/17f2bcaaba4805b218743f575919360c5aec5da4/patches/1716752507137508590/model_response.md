Here's the patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
Explanation:
The error occurs because static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. The `Assume` class is an interface, so we can directly import and use its methods without using a static import.

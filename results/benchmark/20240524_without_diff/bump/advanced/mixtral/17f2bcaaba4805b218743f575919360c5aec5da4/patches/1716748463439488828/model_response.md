Here's the patched version of the code that should resolve the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
Explanation:
Since static imports from classes and interfaces are allowed, we can import `Assume` as a regular import statement and use it with its full name. The error was caused by using a static import on a non-static method, so we removed the static import and used the full name of the method instead.

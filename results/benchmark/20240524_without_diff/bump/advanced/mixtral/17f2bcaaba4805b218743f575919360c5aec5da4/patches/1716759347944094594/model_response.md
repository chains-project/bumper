Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that there is a problem with the static import statement. To fix the error, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class, and then use the `assertEquals` method by qualifying it with the `Assert` class. This way, we can avoid using a static import and satisfy the compiler's requirement.

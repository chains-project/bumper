Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import for the whole `Assume` class. Then, I used the `Assume` class directly by calling its method `assumeTrue` without the static import.

Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this version, we are importing `Assume` as a regular import, rather than using a static import. This allows us to call the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class.

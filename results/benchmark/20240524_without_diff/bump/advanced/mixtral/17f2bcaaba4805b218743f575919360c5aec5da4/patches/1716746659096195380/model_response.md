Here's the fixed failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an explicit import of the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the usage of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`. This way, the client code will not rely on static imports from classes and interfaces, which was causing the error.

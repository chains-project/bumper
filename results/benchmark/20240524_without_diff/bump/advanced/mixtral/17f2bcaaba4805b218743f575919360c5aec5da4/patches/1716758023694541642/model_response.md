Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this fixed version, I've replaced the static import statement with an explicit import for the `Assume` class, and then used the class name to access the `assumeTrue` method. This should resolve the compilation error.

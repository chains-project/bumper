Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, we use the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly in the code. This should resolve the error message about static imports only being allowed from classes and interfaces.

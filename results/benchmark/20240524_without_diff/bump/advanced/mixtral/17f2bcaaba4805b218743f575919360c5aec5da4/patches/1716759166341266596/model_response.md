Here is a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("expected", actual);
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assertEquals` method is being imported statically, which is not allowed. To fix this issue, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class, and then use the `assertEquals` method as a non-static method of the `Assert` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `assertEquals` method is being called with two arguments, as shown in the original code snippet. If the method has a different number or type of arguments, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I have replaced the static import statement with an explicit import of the `Assume` class, and then used the `assumeTrue` method by qualifying it with the class name. This way, the code will not produce the "static import only from classes and interfaces" error.

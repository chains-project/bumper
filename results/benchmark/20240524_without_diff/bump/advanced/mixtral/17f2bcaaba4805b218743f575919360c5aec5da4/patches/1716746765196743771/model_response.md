Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the `Assume` class from the JUnit library is being used, so we can simply remove the static import statement and import the class directly. Then, we need to qualify all uses of `assumeTrue` with the `Assume` class name.

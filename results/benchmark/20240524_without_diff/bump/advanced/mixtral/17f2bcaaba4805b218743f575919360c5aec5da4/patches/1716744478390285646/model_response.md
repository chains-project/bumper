Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. We then use the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This resolves the compilation error.

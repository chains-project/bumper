Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, `assertEquals` is a static method of the `Assert` class. Therefore, we can remove the static import statement and use the fully qualified name of the method instead. This will fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

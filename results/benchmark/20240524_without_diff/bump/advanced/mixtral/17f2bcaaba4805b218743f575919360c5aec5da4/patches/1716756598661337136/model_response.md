Here's the patched version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this patched version, I replaced the problematic static import with an import for the class `org.junit.Assume`. Then, I replaced the usage of the static method `assumeTrue` with its fully qualified name.

This should resolve the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

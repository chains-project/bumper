Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

In the original code, a static import statement is used to import the `assumeTrue` method from the `Assume` class. However, this syntax is not valid because static import statements can only be used to import static members from classes or interfaces, not from individual methods.

To fix the error, we can remove the static import statement and replace it with a regular import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, we can qualify the `assumeTrue` method with the `Assume` class when we use it in our code, like this:

```java
Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```

This will allow the code to compile and run without errors.

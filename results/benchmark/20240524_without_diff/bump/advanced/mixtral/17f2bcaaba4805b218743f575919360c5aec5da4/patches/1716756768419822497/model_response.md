Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an explicit import of the `Assume` class and used its static method `assumeTrue` directly. This should resolve the error message you encountered.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
In this patch, we import the `Assert` class directly instead of using a static import. This allows us to call the `assertEquals` method as a regular method on the `Assert` class.

Note that I had to make a small assumption about the context of the `assertEquals` call, specifically that there are variables `expected` and `actual` defined in the code. If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the arguments to the `assertEquals` method accordingly.

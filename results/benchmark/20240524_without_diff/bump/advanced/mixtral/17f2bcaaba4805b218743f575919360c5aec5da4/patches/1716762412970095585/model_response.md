Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This should resolve the error message about static imports only being allowed from classes and interfaces.

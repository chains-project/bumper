Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the class `org.junit.Assume`. Then, instead of using the static method `assumeTrue` directly, I used it by qualifying it with the class name `Assume.assumeTrue`. This way, the code will not rely on static imports and should resolve the issue.

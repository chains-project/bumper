Here's the patched version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```
The issue with the original code is that it uses a static import statement for a method. Instead, you should directly reference the method using its fully qualified name, as shown in the patched version. This way, you can avoid the error and ensure that the code compiles correctly.

Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import with an explicit import of the `Assume` class, and then used the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should resolve the error you encountered.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```

This patch replaces the problematic static import statement with an equivalent import statement for the `Assume` class, and then uses the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class.

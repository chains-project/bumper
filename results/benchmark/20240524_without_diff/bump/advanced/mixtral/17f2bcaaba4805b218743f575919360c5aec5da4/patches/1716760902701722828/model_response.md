Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the static import statement is causing the issue. To resolve this, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class. Then, I replaced the `assertEquals` method call with its fully qualified name, `Assert.assertEquals`.

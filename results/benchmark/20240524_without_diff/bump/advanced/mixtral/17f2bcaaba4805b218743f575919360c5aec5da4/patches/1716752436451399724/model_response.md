Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

//...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the compilation error caused by the static import.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```
And modify the assertion statement as follows:
```java
Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, we can directly import the Assert class from the org.junit package and use its methods without the need for a static import statement.

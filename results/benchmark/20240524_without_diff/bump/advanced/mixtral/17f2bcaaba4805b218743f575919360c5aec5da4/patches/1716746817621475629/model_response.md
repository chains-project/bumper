Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this version, I replaced the static import statement with an import for the specific `Assume` class and used it directly. Now, the code should work without any issues.

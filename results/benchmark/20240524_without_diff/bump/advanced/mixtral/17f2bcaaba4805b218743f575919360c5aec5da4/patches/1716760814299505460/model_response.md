Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is causing an issue because it can only be used for classes and interfaces. To resolve this issue, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class and use the full method name for the assertEquals method. This way, the code will still work as expected without causing any errors.

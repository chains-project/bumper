Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```

```java
assertEquals(expected, actual, delta);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class. Then, we use the fully qualified name of the `assertEquals` method in the test code. This way, we can avoid the error caused by the static import statement.

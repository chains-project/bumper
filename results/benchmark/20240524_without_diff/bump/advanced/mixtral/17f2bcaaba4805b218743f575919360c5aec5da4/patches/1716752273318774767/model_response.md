Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the `Assume` class is being used correctly, but the static import statement is causing the error. To fix this, we can simply remove the static import statement and use the fully qualified name of the `Assume` class instead.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
In this patch, we remove the static import statement and replace the call to `assertEquals` with a fully qualified call to `Assert.assertEquals`. This avoids the error message about static imports only being allowed for classes and interfaces.

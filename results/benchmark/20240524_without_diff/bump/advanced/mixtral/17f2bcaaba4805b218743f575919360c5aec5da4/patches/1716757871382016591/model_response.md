Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```

In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the call to `assumeTrue` with a direct invocation of the method on the `Assume` class. This should resolve the compilation error.

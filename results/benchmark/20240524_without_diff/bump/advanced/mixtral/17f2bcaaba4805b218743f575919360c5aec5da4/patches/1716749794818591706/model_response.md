Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the `assumeTrue` method directly by qualifying it with the `Assume` class name. This should resolve the error you encountered.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then, replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

This patch removes the static import and instead imports the `Assume` class directly. The `assumeTrue` method is then accessed using the class name, which is allowed by the Java syntax.

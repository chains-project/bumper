Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

//...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should fix the error caused by the static import statement.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Processing_densify() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Processing.densify(GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertTrue(out.getChildCount() == 2);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method with the `assertTrue` method from the `Assertions` class in the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package. This is because the `assumeTrue` method is not a standard JUnit method, and it may have been accidentally imported from a wrong package. By using `assertTrue` instead, the test will still fail if the condition is not met, but it will do so in a more standard way.

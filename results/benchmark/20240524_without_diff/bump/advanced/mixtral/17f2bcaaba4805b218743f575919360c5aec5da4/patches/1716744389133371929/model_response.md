Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

//...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assumeTrue` method is a static method of the `Assume` class. Therefore, we can directly import the `Assume` class and call the `assumeTrue` method without using a static import.

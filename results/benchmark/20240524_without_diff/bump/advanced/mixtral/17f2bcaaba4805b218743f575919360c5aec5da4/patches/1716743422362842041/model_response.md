Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and changed the usage of `assumeTrue` to use the fully qualified name of the method. This should fix the error message you were encountering.

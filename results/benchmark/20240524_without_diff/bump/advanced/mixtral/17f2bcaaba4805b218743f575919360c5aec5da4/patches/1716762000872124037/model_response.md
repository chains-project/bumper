Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Processing_removeSmallHoles() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Processing.removeSmallHoles(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    assertTrue(out.getChildCount() == 2);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method with the `assertTrue` method, which is a more appropriate way to check for a condition that must be true for the test to proceed. The `assumeTrue` method is typically used to provide more informative failure messages when the condition is not met, but it does not fail the test. In this case, it is better to use `assertTrue` to make it clear that a failed condition indicates a failure of the test.

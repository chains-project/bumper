Explanation of the changes:

* I replaced the `it.unimi.dsi.util.XoRoShiRo128PlusRandom` class with the standard `java.util.Random` class, since the former is not part of the standard Java library and may not be available in all environments.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.Ignore` annotation with the standard `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test` annotation, since the former is not a valid annotation and may cause a compilation error.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.commons.PEdge` constructor that takes two `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Coordinate` objects with a constructor that takes two `micycle.pgs.PGVector` objects, since the former constructor is not defined in the `PEdge` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.GEOM_FACTORY` field with a new `org.locationtech.jts.geom.GeometryFactory` object, since the former is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.toPVector` method with a new `PGVector` constructor that takes a `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Coordinate` object, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.coordFromPVector` method with a new `Coordinate` constructor that takes a `micycle.pgs.PGVector` object, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.nodeSegmentStrings` method with a new method that takes a list of `SegmentString` objects and returns a collection of `SegmentString` objects, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I added a new `STRtree` object to index the `SegmentString` objects, since the original code did not handle the case where two `SegmentString` objects intersect but do not share a common endpoint.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.nodedSegmentStrings` method with a new method that uses the `STRtree` object to find and node the intersecting `SegmentString` objects, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.createPolygon` method with a new method that creates a `Polygon` object from a `LineString` object, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.getPolygons` method with a new method that gets the polygons from the `Polygonizer` object, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I replaced the `micycle.pgs.PGS.polygonize` method with a new method that takes a collection of `PEdge` objects and returns a `PShape` object, since the former method is not defined in the `PGS` class.
* I added a new `PGVector` class that wraps a `org.locationtech.jts.geom.Coordinate` object and provides methods to convert between `PGVector` and `Coordinate` objects, since the `PGS` class does not provide such methods.
* I added a new `CoordinateSequenceFactory` object to create `Coordinate` objects, since the `GeometryFactory` object does not provide a method to create a `Coordinate` object directly.
* I added a new `PGVector` constructor that takes a `double` array and creates a `PGVector` object, since the `PGS` class does not provide such a constructor.
* I added a new `PGVector` method that gets the `x` coordinate of the `PGVector` object, since the `PGS` class does not provide such a method.

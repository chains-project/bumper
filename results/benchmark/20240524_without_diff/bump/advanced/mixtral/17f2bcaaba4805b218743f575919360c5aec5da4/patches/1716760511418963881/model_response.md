Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
The issue with the original code is that it uses a static import statement for a method from the `Assume` class. Instead, you should use the fully qualified name of the class and its method.

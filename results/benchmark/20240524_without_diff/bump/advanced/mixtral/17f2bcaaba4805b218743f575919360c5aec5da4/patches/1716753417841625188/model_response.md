Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I've replaced the static import statement with an import for the whole class, and then used the class name to access the `assumeTrue` method.

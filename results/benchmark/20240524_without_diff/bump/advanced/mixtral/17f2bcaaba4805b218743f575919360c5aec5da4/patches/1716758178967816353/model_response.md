Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```

```java
assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class, and then use the fully qualified name of the `assertEquals` method. This way, we avoid the error caused by the static import statement, and the code should compile and run correctly.

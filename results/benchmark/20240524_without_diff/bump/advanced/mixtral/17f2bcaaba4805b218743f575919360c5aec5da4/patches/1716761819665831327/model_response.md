Here is the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In the original code, a static import statement was used to import the `assertEquals` method from the `Assert` class. However, this is not allowed.
To fix the error, we can remove the static import statement and instead use the fully-qualified name of the `Assert` class to call the `assertEquals` method. This is shown in the fixed version of the method.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

The patch removes the static import statement and replaces it with an import statement for the `Assume` class. It then replaces the call to `assumeTrue` with a fully qualified call to `Assume.assumeTrue`. This should resolve the error message.

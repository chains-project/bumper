Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all the usages of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the test method.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static import is only allowed for classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is an abstract class. Therefore, we cannot use static import for `Assume`. Instead, we can import `Assume` class directly and use its methods with the full class name.

Note:

This patch assumes that there is only one usage of `assumeTrue` in the test method. If there are multiple usages, they need to be replaced accordingly.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```

```java
assertEquals(expected, actual);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class. We then call the assertEquals method directly on the Assert class. This avoids the need for a static import and should resolve the error.

Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```
And replace all the usages of `assertEquals` with `Assert.assertEquals` in the test methods.

This patch removes the static import statement, which is causing the error, and imports the Assert class instead. Then, it replaces the usages of the `assertEquals` method with the fully qualified name `Assert.assertEquals`.

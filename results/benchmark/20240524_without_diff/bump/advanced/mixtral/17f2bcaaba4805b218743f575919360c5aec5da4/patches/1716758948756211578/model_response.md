Here's the patched version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
The issue with the original code is the usage of a static import statement for a method. Instead, you can directly import the class and use its method as shown in the patched version.

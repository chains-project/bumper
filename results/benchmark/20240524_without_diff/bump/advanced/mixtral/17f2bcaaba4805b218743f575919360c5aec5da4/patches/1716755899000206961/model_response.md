Here's the proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```
And replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the test methods.

This patch removes the static import and imports the `Assume` class directly. It also replaces all instances of `assumeTrue` with the fully qualified method name. This should resolve the error related to static import only from classes and interfaces.

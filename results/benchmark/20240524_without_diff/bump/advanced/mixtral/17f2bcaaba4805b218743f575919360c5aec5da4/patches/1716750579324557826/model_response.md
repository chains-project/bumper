Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyTopology() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.simplifyTopology(GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The error message you provided suggests that the `assumeTrue` method cannot be found. This method is part of the JUnit 4 testing framework, but you are using JUnit 5 in your code. In JUnit 5, the equivalent method is called `assertTrue`. Therefore, I have replaced the `assumeTrue` method with `assertTrue` in the patched code.

I have also imported the `assertTrue` method using a static import statement to make the code more concise. This is not necessary, but it can make the code easier to read.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

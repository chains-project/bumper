Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assertEquals` method is a static method of the `Assert` class, so we can import the class directly and call the method without using a static import. This will avoid the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the static import statement is only allowed for classes and interfaces. In this case, the import statement is trying to import a static method from the `Assert` class. To fix this, we can remove the static import statement and directly use the `assertEquals` method by qualifying it with the name of the class (`Assert`).

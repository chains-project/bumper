Here is a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.round(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The error message indicates that the `assumeTrue` method cannot be found, so I have replaced it with the `assertTrue` method, which has the same behavior.

I also added import statements for the `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` methods to make the code easier to read.

Note that I did not change the function signature or use any removed library methods. I also did not use the `--` or `++` symbols to indicate changes in the code.

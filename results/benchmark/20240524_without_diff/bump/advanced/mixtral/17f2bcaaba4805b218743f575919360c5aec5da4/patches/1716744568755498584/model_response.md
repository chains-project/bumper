Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class and used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This way, we avoid using a static import for a method, which is causing the error.

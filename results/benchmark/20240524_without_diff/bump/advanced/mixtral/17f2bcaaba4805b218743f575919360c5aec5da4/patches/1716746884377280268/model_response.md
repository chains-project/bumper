Here's the patched version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patched version, I replaced the static import of `org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue` with an import of the `Assume` class, and then called the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should resolve the error you encountered.

Here is the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, we removed the static import statement and replaced it with an import statement for the `Assume` class. We then use the `Assume` class directly, instead of its static method `assumeTrue()`. This avoids the need for a static import and should resolve the error.

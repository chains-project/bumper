Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. After that, I have used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly instead of using the static import. This should resolve the error related to the static import.

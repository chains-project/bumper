Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import for the class `org.junit.Assume` and used the class name to access the `assumeTrue` method. This should resolve the error you encountered.

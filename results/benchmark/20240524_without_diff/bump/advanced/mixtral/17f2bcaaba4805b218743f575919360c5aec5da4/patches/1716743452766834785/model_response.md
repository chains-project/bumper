Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, we are no longer using a static import, but instead using the normal import syntax and calling the `assumeTrue` method on the `Assume` class directly. This should resolve the error message you were seeing.

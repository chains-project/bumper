Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch replaces the problematic static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then directly calls the `assumeTrue` method on the `Assume` class.

Here is a fixed version of the client code that removes the failing static import:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this fixed version, we import `Assume` as a regular (non-static) import, and then use it as a regular method call. This should resolve the compilation error.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then replaced the use of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`. This should fix the error message you were seeing.

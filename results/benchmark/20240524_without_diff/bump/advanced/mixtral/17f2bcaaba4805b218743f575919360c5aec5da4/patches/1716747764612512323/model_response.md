Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this version, we are using the regular import statement instead of the static import statement. Then, we are calling the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should fix the error you were encountering.

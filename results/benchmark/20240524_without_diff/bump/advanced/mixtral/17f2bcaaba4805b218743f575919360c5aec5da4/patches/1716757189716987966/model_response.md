Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;
```

```java
assertEquals(expected, actual);
```

In this patch, we have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class. We have also removed the static keyword from the `assertEquals` method call. This allows us to call the method directly on the `Assert` class, without needing to import it statically.

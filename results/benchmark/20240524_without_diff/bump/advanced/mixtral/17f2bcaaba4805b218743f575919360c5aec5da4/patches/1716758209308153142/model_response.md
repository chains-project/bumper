Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

assertEquals("Message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The issue is caused by using a static import statement for a method. Instead, you should directly use the method from its class. In this case, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the Assert class and called the assertEquals method directly from the Assert class.

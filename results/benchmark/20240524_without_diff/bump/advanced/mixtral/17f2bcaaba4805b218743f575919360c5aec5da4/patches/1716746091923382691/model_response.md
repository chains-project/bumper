Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the entire class, and then used the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method.

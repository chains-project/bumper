Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

//...

assertEquals("message", expected, actual);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that there's a problem with the static import statement. To fix this, we can replace the static import with an import of the `Assert` class and use the fully qualified name of the `assertEquals` method instead. This way, the code will still work as expected, but without causing any issues with the static import.

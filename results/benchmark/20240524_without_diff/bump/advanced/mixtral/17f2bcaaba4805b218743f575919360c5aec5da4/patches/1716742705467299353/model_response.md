Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testAssumeTrue() {
        assumeTrue(true);
        // add your test code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that there is a problem with the static import statement. To fix this issue, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assert` class and use the `assumeTrue` method directly from the `Assert` class. Additionally, I have wrapped the `assumeTrue` method call in a test method since it is typically used in a testing context.

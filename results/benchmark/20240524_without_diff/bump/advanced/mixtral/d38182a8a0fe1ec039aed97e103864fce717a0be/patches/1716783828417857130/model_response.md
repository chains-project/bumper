Here's a possible patch for the code you provided. I added a cast to `(User)` to the result of `new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User(user.name())` to satisfy the compiler.

```java
@java.lang.Override
public com.artipie.http.Slice slice(final java.lang.String action) {
    return new com.artipie.docker.http.DockerSlice(new com.artipie.docker.asto.AstoDocker(new com.artipie.asto.memory.InMemoryStorage()), new com.artipie.http.auth.Permissions.Single(TestAuthentication.ALICE.name(), action), new com.artipie.http.auth.BearerAuthScheme(( token) -> java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.completedFuture(java.util.stream.Stream.of(TestAuthentication.ALICE, TestAuthentication.BOB).filter(( user) -> token.equals(token(user))).map(( user) -> (com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User) new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User(user.name())).findFirst()), ""));
}
```

Note that this is just a workaround for the compilation error, and it doesn't address the underlying issue of the missing `User` class. It's possible that the `User` class was removed or moved in a recent version of the library you're using, or that you have a version mismatch between your dependencies. You should check the library documentation and make sure you're using the correct version and configuration.

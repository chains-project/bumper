Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    TDeserializer deserializer;
    try {
        deserializer = new TDeserializer(new TCompactProtocol.Factory());
    } catch (org.apache.thrift.TException e) {
        throw new java.lang.RuntimeException(e);
    }
    return deserializer;
}
```

The error message indicates that the symbol `TTransportException` cannot be found. This suggests that the class `TTransportException` is no longer available in the external dependency. Therefore, I have replaced the exception class with its parent class `TException` in the `catch` block. This should resolve the error and allow the code to compile.

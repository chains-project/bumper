Here's the patched version of the `init` method:
```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
In the original code, `com.pinterest.singer.client.logback.TFastFramedTransport` was used. However, the error message indicates that the `TFastFramedTransport` class cannot be found. Instead, I've replaced it with `org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport`, which is part of the Apache Thrift library and should be available.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class remains unchanged since it is part of the same library as `TFramedTransport`. The `TBinaryProtocol` class is also unchanged, as it is used to serialize and deserialize data in Thrift format.

The `bufferCapacity` variable and its usage remain the same since it is not related to the dependency issue. The `framedTransport` and `protocol` variables are assigned the new instances.

This patch should resolve the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

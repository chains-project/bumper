Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `com.pinterest.singer.client.logback.TFastFramedTransport` class with the `org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport` class.

The `TFastFramedTransport` class is not part of the Apache Thrift library, and is likely a custom class implemented by the authors of the original code.

The `TFramedTransport` class, on the other hand, is a part of the Apache Thrift library and provides similar functionality to the `TFastFramedTransport` class.

By using the `TFramedTransport` class, we can avoid the error caused by the missing `TFastFramedTransport` class.

Note that this patch may not provide the same performance or behavior as the original code, as the `TFramedTransport` class may have different implementation details compared to the `TFastFramedTransport` class.

However, this patch should be sufficient to fix the compilation error and allow the code to run.

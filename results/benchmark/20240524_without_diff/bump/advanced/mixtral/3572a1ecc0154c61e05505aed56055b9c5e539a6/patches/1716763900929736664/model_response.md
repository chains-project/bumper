Here is a potential patch for the given client code:
```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os));
    framedTransport.setFramedTransportBufferSize(bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
In this patch, we have replaced the use of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport`, which should be available in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. We have also set the buffer size of the `TFramedTransport` to the desired capacity of 10.

Note that this patch assumes that the `framedTransport` and `protocol` fields have been declared appropriately in the enclosing class. If this is not the case, the necessary declarations will need to be added.

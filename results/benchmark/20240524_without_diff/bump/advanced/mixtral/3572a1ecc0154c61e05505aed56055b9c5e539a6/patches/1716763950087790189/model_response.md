Here's the patched method:
```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
Note: I've replaced the `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport` since the latter is a direct replacement and part of the Thrift library. This should resolve the compilation error.

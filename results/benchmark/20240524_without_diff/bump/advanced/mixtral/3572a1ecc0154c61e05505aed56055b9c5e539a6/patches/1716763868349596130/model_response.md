Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
protected TDeserializer initialValue() {
    TDeserializer deserializer;
    try {
        deserializer = new TDeserializer(new TCompactProtocol.Factory());
    } catch (TTransportException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    return deserializer;
}
```
This patch wraps the construction of the `TDeserializer` object in a try-catch block, which catches the `TTransportException` that is causing the failure. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown as a `RuntimeException`. This allows the failure to be handled at a higher level of the application, while still preserving the original cause of the failure.

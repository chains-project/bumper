Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os));
    framedTransport.setFramedTransportBufferSize(bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFastFramedTransport` class cannot be found. This class is part of the `com.pinterest.singer.client.logback` package, which is not a standard Thrift class. I assume that this class is not available or has been removed from the project.

To fix the error, I replaced the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the standard `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. I also set the frame size using the `setFramedTransportBufferSize` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `framedTransport` variable is declared as a `org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport` object. If the variable has a different type, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
        encryptor.setPassword("my-secret-password");
    }

    public String encode(String rawPassword) {
        return encryptor.encrypt(rawPassword);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return encryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword, encodedPassword);
    }
}
```
Note that this patch replaces the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class, but it does not require any Spring-specific dependencies.

Also note that I've added a constructor to the `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class that initializes the `BasicTextEncryptor` object with a secret password. You can replace "my-secret-password" with a more secure password of your choice.

Finally, I've updated the `encode` and `matches` methods to use the `BasicTextEncryptor` class instead of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class. The `encrypt` method is used to encode a raw password, and the `checkPassword` method is used to verify that a raw password matches an encoded password.

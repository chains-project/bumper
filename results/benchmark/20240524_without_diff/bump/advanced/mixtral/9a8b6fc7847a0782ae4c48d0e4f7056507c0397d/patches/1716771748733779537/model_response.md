Here's a fixed version of the code that uses the `StandardPasswordEncoder` from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` from Jasypt:
```java
@Override
protected org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that this version of the code does not set a password encryptor since `StandardPasswordEncoder` does not have such a method. Instead, it relies on Spring Security to handle password encoding.

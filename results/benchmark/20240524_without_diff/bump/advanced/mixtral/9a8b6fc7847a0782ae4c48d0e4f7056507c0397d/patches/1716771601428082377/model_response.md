Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that this patch uses the `StandardPasswordEncoder` class from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` from jasypt. This is because the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class from jasypt is no longer available in the latest version of the library. The `StandardPasswordEncoder` class provides similar functionality to `StrongPasswordEncryptor`.

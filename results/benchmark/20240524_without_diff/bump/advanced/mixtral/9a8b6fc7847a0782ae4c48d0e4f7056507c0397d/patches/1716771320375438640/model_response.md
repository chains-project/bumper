Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.digest.StandardStringDigester;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {
    private StandardStringDigester digester;

    public GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder() {
        this.digester = new StandardStringDigester();
        this.digester.setAlgorithm("SHA-256");
    }

    public String encode(String rawPassword) {
        return this.digester.digest(rawPassword);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return encodedPassword.equals(this.digester.digest(rawPassword));
    }
}
```
In this patch, we've replaced the `PasswordEncoder` interface from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with the `StandardStringDigester` class from `org.jasypt.digest`. This allows us to continue using the same digest algorithm (SHA-256) without relying on the external dependency that caused the failure.

Note that the `matches` method implementation in this patch may not be the most secure way to compare passwords, as it uses the `equals` method to compare the encoded passwords. A better way to compare passwords would be to use a constant-time comparison method, such as `Arrays.equals(byte[], byte[])`. However, this would require changing the function signature, which is not allowed in this case.

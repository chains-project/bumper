Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;
```

Explanation:

The original code imports `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder`, but the error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. It's possible that the dependency for this package is missing or outdated.

To fix the error, we can use the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package instead, which provides similar functionality. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.password.PBEPasswordEncoder;

// Change the import statement to use the non-Spring version of PBEPasswordEncoder
// and initialize it as follows:

PBEPasswordEncoder encoder = new PBEPasswordEncoder();
encoder.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
encoder.setPasswordCryptographer(new StringPBECryptographer());
```
This patch replaces the failed import statement with the non-Spring version of `PBEPasswordEncoder` and initializes it with the required algorithm and password cryptographer.

Note: This patch assumes that the `StringPBECryptographer` class is available in the classpath. If it is not, you may need to add it as a dependency.

Here's a fixed version of the method that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` class from Jasypt:

```java
@Override
protected org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```

This version should work as long as Spring Security is available on the classpath. Note that the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class is not used in this version.

Here's a fixed version of the method that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` class from Jasypt, which may have been removed or is otherwise unavailable:
```java
@Override
protected org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that this version of the method returns an instance of `BCryptPasswordEncoder`, which implements the `PasswordEncoder` interface from Spring Security. This should allow you to continue using the `PasswordEncoder` interface in your code, but with a different implementation that is available in your environment.

Here's a fixed version of the code that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` class from Jasypt. This should resolve the issue with the missing symbol.
```java
@Override
protected org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that this version of the code uses fully qualified class names to avoid any potential naming conflicts. Also, since the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class implements the `PasswordEncoder` interface from Spring Security, the method signature remains unchanged.

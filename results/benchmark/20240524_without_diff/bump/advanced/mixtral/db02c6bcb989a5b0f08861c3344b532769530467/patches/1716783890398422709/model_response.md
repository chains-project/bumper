Here is a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the constructor for `StringContains` is expecting a single `String` argument, but it's receiving two arguments: a `boolean` and a `String`.
The original code passes `false` as the first argument, which is unnecessary.
The fixed code only passes the formatted string as the argument, which should resolve the error.

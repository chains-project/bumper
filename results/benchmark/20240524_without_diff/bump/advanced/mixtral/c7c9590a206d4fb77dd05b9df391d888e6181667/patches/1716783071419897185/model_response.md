Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.Renderer;

// ...

@Override
protected void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // Use a different class from the same package
    Renderer renderer = new org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.XHTMLRenderer();

    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we're importing a different class from the same package as the original missing class. This should fix the compilation error without changing the function signature or using any removed library methods. Note that we cannot be sure this will not introduce any new errors, as we don't know how the `Renderer` object is used later in the code.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
```
Explanation:
The original import statement imports a class from the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render`. However, the error message indicates that this package does not exist. Therefore, we need to find an alternative package that contains a similar class.
After some research, I found that the class `RenderingContext` is also available in the package `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer`. Therefore, we can replace the original import statement with the new one that imports the `RenderingContext` class from the new package.
This should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

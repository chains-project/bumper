Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.Renderer;

// ...

Renderer renderer = new Renderer();
RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext.Builder().build();
// Use 'renderer' and 'renderingContext' objects as needed...
```
This patch replaces the missing `RenderingContext` class with a new `Renderer` and `RenderingContext` objects, which should provide similar functionality. Note that the `RenderingContext.Builder` class is used to create the `RenderingContext` object, which is a new method added in a newer version of the library.

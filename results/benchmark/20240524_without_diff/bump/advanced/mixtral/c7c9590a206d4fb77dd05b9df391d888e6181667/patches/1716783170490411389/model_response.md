Here's a proposed patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

// ...

@Override
protected void executeReport(Locale locale, ResourceBundle bundle, PrintStream out) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    Sink sink = createSink();
    // ...
    renderingContext = new RenderingContext();
    renderingContext.setSink(sink);
    // ...
}

private Sink createSink() {
    return new XhtmlSink();
}
```
Note that the `RenderingContext` class is still used, but it's no longer imported from the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package. Instead, a `Sink` is used directly. The `XhtmlSink` class is used to create a new `Sink` instance.

This patch assumes that the `XhtmlSink` class is available in the classpath, and it provides the same functionality as the original `RenderingContext` class. If the `XhtmlSink` class is not available, you may need to find an alternative class that provides similar functionality.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.special.Sigma.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` method from the `org.apache.commons.math3.special` package. This package provides a similar `sigmoid` method that can be used as a replacement for the one in the failing code.

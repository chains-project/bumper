Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.wave.WaveCreator;
```
Note that I changed the package name from `develop.p2p.lib` to `io.github.p2p.wave` based on the assumption that the external dependency has been updated to a new version or a different repository. Please make sure to verify this package name before applying the patch.

Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import static tech.develop.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```
In this patch, I replaced the non-existent package `develop.p2p.lib` with the new package `tech.develop.lib`. This assumes that the `sigmoid` method can be found in the `tech.develop.lib.LearnMath` class. If the class location is different, please replace the package and class name accordingly.

Here's the proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.special.Sigmoid.sigmoid;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` method from the `org.apache.commons.math3.special` package, which provides a similar sigmoid function.

Please note that this solution assumes the required library is added as a dependency in the project configuration. If not, you should add the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-math3</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```
Or, if you are using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'
```
This will ensure that the required library is available for your project.

Here's the fixed failing method:
```java
import com.develop.p2p.lib.*;
```
Note: I replaced `develop` with `com.develop` since it's a common convention for package names to start with a reversed domain name. This might not be the actual solution, but it's a possible fix for the issue. You may need to check the actual package name of the external dependency and adjust the import statement accordingly.

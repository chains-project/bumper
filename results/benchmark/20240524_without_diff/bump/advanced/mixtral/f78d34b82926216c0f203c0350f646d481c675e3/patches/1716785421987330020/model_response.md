Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.special.Sigma.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from Apache Commons Math library, which provides a similar functionality as the failing library.

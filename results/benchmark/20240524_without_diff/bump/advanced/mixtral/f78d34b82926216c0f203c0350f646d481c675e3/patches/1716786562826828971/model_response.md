Here's the modified code that replaces the failing client code:
```java
import org.example.ExternalDependencyLib.*;
```
Please note that you will need to replace `org.example.ExternalDependencyLib.*` with the actual package name of the library that provides the required functionality. This code assumes that the library has been added as a dependency with the correct package name in your project's build configuration.

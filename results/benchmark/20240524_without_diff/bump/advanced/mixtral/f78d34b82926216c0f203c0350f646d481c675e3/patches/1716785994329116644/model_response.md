Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.wave.WaveCreator;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `WaveCreator` class from the `io.github.p2p.wave` package, which is presumably the new location of the external dependency. This assumes that the `WaveCreator` class and its functionality have not changed, so the client code can continue to use it in the same way as before.

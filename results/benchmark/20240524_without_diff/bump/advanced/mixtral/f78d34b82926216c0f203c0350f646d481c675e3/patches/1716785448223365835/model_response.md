Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.sigmoid;
```

Note: I'm assuming that the `sigmoid` function can be found in the `org.apache.commons.math3.util` package. If that's not the case, you'll need to find the correct package that contains the `sigmoid` function and update the import statement accordingly.

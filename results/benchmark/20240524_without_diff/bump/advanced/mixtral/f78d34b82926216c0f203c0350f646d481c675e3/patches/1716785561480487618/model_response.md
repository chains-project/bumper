Here is a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.CompositeFunction.sigmoid;
```
Explanation:
The original code imports the `sigmoid` method from the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class, but the error message indicates that the package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist. To fix this, we need to find an alternative implementation of the `sigmoid` method.
One such implementation is available in the Apache Commons Math library, specifically in the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.CompositeFunction` class. We can import this method using the proposed import statement.
Note that this solution assumes that the Apache Commons Math library is already included in the project's dependencies. If not, it will need to be added.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import develop.p2p.lib.v2.*;
```
This patch assumes that the missing package has been updated to a new version, and that the client code needs to use the new version instead. By importing `develop.p2p.lib.v2.*`, we ensure that the client code can access the updated package and its contents. Note that this is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the error depending on the specific situation and the changes made to the external dependency.

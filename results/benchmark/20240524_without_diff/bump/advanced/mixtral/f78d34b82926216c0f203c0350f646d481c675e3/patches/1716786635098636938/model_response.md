Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import develop.p2p.lib.v2.*;
```
This patch assumes that the external dependency has been updated to version 2, and that the package name has been changed accordingly. If the version number or package name is different, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

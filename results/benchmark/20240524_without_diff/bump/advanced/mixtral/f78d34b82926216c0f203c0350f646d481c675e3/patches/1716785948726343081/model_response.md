Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```
In this patch, I've changed the package import statement to use the new location of the `WaveCreator` class.
The original package `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, so I've updated it to the new location `io.github.p2p.lib`.
This should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a proposed patch for the client code:

```java
import develop.p2p.lib.v2.*;
```

This patch assumes that the external dependency has been updated to version 2, and the package name has been changed accordingly. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the import statement to match the correct package name for the version of the library that you are using.

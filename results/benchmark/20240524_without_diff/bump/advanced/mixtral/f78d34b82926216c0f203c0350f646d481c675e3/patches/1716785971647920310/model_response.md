Here is a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `WaveCreator` class from the `io.github.p2p.lib` package. This package is likely a renamed version of the original `develop.p2p.lib` package, which is no longer available or has been moved to a different location.

Note that the package name is not the only thing that has changed in this patch. The domain name of the package has also changed from `develop` to `io.github`. This suggests that the library has been moved to a different repository or organization on GitHub.

It's possible that the library has undergone other changes as well, such as version updates or API modifications. Therefore, it's important to consult the library's documentation or contact its maintainers to ensure compatibility with the client code.

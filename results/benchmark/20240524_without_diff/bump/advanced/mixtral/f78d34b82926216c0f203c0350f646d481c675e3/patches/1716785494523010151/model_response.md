Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision.*;

//...

double sigmoid(double x) {
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-x));
}
```
Explanation:

Since the external dependency `develop.p2p.lib` does not exist, we need to replace the usage of `LearnMath.sigmoid` method with our own implementation.

In this case, we can use the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision` library which provides a method for calculating the exponential function (`exp`).

We then use this method to implement our own `sigmoid` function.

Note: This solution assumes that the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision` library is available and included in the project's dependencies.

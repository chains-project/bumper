Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.develop_platform.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that uses the fully qualified name of the `WaveCreator` class in the updated package `io.github.develop_platform.p2p.lib`. This assumes that the external dependency has been updated to a new version with a different package name.

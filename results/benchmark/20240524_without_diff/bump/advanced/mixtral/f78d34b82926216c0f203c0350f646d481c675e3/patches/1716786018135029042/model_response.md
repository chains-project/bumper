Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.wave.WaveCreator;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that uses the fully qualified name of the `WaveCreator` class from the `io.github.p2p.wave` package. This package is a possible alternative to the `develop.p2p.lib` package, which seems to be unavailable or incorrect.

Note that this patch assumes that the `WaveCreator` class and its functionality have not changed between the two packages. If there are any differences or incompatibilities, further modifications to the client code may be necessary.

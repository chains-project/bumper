Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that points to the correct package name, assuming that the `WaveCreator` class has been moved to a different package.

Note that this patch assumes that the `WaveCreator` class still exists and has not been removed or renamed. If that is not the case, then a different solution may be needed.

Here's a proposed patch that replaces the failing client code:
```java
import develop.p2p.lib.v2.*;
```
This patch replaces the original import statement with a new one that imports the same package from version 2. It's assumed that the external dependency has been updated to version 2, which is causing the failure. By importing version 2 of the library, the client code should be able to compile and run successfully.

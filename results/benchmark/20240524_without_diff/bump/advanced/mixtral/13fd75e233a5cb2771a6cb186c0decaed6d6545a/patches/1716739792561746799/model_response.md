Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
In the original code, the `StringContains` constructor was being called with two arguments, but it should only take one argument. I removed the first argument `false` to fix the issue.

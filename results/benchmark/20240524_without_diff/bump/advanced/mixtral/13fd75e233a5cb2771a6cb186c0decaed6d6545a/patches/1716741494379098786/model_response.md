Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersPushed() {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("%s: Pushed", this.image.layer()));
}
```
In this patch, I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it is not needed and is causing a compilation error. The `StringContains` constructor only requires a single argument, which is the expected substring.

Here's a potential patch for the given client code:
```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersAlreadyExist() {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.IsNot(new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(this.image.layer()));
}
```
The original code was using the `StringContains` constructor that takes two arguments (a boolean and a string), but the code should be using the constructor that takes a single argument (a string). The updated code creates a new `StringContains` matcher using the single-argument constructor, and then wraps it in an `IsNot` matcher to achieve the same behavior as the original code.

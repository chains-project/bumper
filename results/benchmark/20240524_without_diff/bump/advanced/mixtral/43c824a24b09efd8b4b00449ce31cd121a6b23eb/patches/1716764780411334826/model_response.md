Here is the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

The change is to replace `JsonBranch` with `Object` as the type of the `branch` parameter. This is because the error message suggests that the `JsonBranch` class is not found, which could mean that it is missing from the classpath or has been removed from the project. By using `Object` instead, we can avoid the need for the missing class and still allow the method to accept any object as input. However, this change may require additional modifications to the code to ensure that the `branch` object is of the expected type.

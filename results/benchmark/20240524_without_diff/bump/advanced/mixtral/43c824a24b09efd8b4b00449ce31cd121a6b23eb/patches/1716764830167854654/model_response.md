Here's a fixed version of the `extractFirst` method that removes the dependency on `JsonBranch`:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

Note that I removed the `branch` parameter from the method signature and the corresponding usage in the method body. It seems like `extractList` method of `MarcFactory` class doesn't require the `branch` parameter, so I removed it to fix the compilation error. However, this change might affect the functionality of the method, so you should carefully test it to make sure it still meets your requirements.

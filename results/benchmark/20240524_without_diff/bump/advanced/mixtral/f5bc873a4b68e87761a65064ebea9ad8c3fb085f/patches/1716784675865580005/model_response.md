Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```

This patch imports the missing `MavenProject` class from the correct package, which should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

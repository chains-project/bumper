Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
In this patch, we import the fully qualified name of the `MavenProject` class from the `org.apache.maven.project` package. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that I am assuming that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized appropriately in the enclosing class. If this is not the case, additional changes may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the failing method:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
This patch imports the correct `MavenProject` class from the `org.apache.maven.project` package, which should fix the "cannot find symbol" error. Note that this assumes that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized correctly in the enclosing class.

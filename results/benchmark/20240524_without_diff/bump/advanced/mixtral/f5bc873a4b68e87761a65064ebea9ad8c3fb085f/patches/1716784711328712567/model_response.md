Here is a possible patch for the given code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the symbol `MavenProject` cannot be found, which means that the class is not imported properly. Therefore, we need to import the fully qualified name of the `MavenProject` class at the beginning of the file.
Note that I assumed that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized properly in the `AbstractThemeMojo` class. If this is not the case, you may need to initialize it before returning it.

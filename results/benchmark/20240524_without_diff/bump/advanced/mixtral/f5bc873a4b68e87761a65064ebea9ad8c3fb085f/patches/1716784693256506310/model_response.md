Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
This patch imports the missing `MavenProject` class from the fully qualified package `org.apache.maven.project` and uses it in the method signature. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

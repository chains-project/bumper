Here's a patched version of the client code that replaces the failing import statement with a try-catch block to handle the missing dependency:
```java
try {
    import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle the missing dependency here
    System.out.println("Error importing MavenProject: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
Note that this patch only provides a workaround for the missing dependency by catching the `ImportError` exception and printing an error message. It does not actually fix the underlying issue of the missing dependency. To fully resolve the issue, you would need to add the missing dependency to your project's classpath.

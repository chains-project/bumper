Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
The patch imports the missing `MavenProject` class from the correct package, assuming that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized correctly. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the rest of the code accordingly.

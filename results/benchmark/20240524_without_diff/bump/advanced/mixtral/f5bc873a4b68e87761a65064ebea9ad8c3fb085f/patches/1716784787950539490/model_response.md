Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
This patch imports the missing `MavenProject` class from the `org.apache.maven.project` package and uses it in the method signature.

Note that this assumes that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized appropriately in the enclosing class. If that's not the case, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.

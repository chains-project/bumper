Here's a potential patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.shared.utils.os.LinuxDirectoryScanner;

static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    LinuxDirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new LinuxDirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder);
    return directoryScanner.scan().getIncludedFiles();
}
```

Note that I replaced `DirectoryScanner` from `org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util` with `LinuxDirectoryScanner` from `org.apache.maven.shared.utils.os`. I also replaced `getClasses()` with `getIncludedFiles()` since `getClasses()` is not available in `LinuxDirectoryScanner`.

Please note that this patch may not work as expected if the original code has specific requirements that are not met by `LinuxDirectoryScanner`. It's always a good idea to test the patched code thoroughly to ensure that it works as intended.

Here's a possible patch for the given code:
```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.shared.utils.io.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.shared.utils.io.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, new org.apache.maven.shared.utils.StringUtils.PatternHelper().getWildcardPattern());
    return directoryScanner.scan();
}
```
Explanation:
In the original code, the `getWildcard()` method is called on `TestListResolver` class, which belongs to the `org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset` package. However, this method is not static, so an instance of `TestListResolver` should be created first.

However, instead of fixing the original code by creating an instance of `TestListResolver`, I propose a different solution that uses a similar class from a different package. Specifically, I use the `DirectoryScanner` class from the `org.apache.maven.shared.utils.io` package, and the `getWildcardPattern()` method from the `StringUtils.PatternHelper` class from the same package.

The `DirectoryScanner` class works similarly to the original `DirectoryScanner` class, but it takes a pattern string as its second argument instead of a `TestListResolver` instance. The `getWildcardPattern()` method from `StringUtils.PatternHelper` returns a pattern string that matches any file or directory, similar to the wildcard character `*`.

Therefore, the patched code creates an instance of `DirectoryScanner` and passes it the `testSrcFolder` argument and the pattern string returned by `getWildcardPattern()`. Then, it calls the `scan()` method on the `DirectoryScanner` instance to get the list of classes.

Note that this solution assumes that the `DirectoryScanner` class and the `StringUtils.PatternHelper` class are available in the project's classpath. If they are not, the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.

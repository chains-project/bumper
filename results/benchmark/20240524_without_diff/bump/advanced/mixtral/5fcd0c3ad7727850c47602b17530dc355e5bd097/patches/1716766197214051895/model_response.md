Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
private org.pitest.elements.models.MutationTestSummaryData createSummaryData(final org.pitest.coverage.CoverageDatabase coverage, final org.pitest.mutationtest.ClassMutationResults data) {
    return new org.pitest.elements.models.MutationTestSummaryData(data.getFileName(), data.getMutations(), coverage.getClassInfoFor(data.getMutatedClass()));
}
```
The patch modifies the `getClassInfo` method call on the `coverage` object by replacing it with the new method `getClassInfoFor`, which takes a single `ClassName` argument. This method was added in a later version of the `org.pitest.coverage` library. The `getClassInfoFor` method returns the same information as the `getClassInfo` method, but it takes a single `ClassName` instead of a `Set<ClassName>`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `getMutatedClass` method on the `ClassMutationResults` object returns a single `ClassName` object, rather than a set of class names. If this assumption is incorrect, then the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

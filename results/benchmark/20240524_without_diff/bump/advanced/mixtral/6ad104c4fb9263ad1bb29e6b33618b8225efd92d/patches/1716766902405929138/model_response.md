Here is a proposed patch for the client code:

```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Note: It appears that there is a typo in the import statement in the original client code. The package name should be "org.bouncecastle" instead of "org.bouncycastle". The proposed patch fixes this typo.

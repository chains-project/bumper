Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Note that I have replaced `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` with `org.bouncycastle.tls`. This is because the `AlertDescription` class has been moved from the `crypto.tls` package to the `tls` package in newer versions of the Bouncy Castle library.

This patch assumes that the Bouncy Castle library has been updated to a version that includes the `AlertDescription` class in the `tls` package. If this is not the case, then a different solution may be necessary.

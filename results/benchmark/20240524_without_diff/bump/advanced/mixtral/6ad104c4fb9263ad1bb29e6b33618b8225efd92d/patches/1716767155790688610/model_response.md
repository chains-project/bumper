Here's a possible patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.ChaChaEngine;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.ParametersWithIV;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // existing code

    private void decode(byte[] input, byte[] output) {
        ChaChaEngine engine = new ChaChaEngine();
        KeyParameter keyParam = new KeyParameter(key.getBytes());
        engine.init(true, new ParametersWithIV(keyParam, nonce));
        engine.processBytes(input, 0, input.length, output, 0);
    }
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert` import with the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.ChaChaEngine` import, which is a part of the Bouncy Castle library that is still available. I also modified the `decode` method to use the `ChaChaEngine` instead of the `TlsFatalAlert` class. The `ChaChaEngine` is used to perform the ChaCha20 encryption/decryption, which is what I assume the original code was trying to do.

Note that this patch assumes that the `key` and `nonce` variables are defined elsewhere in the code and that they contain the necessary values for the encryption/decryption. You may need to adjust the code accordingly if these variables are not defined or if they require additional processing.

Here's a proposed patch for the client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Note: I replaced `crypto.tls` with `tls` in the package name.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This suggests that the client code is using an outdated or incorrect package name for the Bouncy Castle library.

After checking the official documentation for the Bouncy Castle library, I found that the correct package name for the `AlertDescription` class is `org.bouncycastle.tls`. Therefore, I replaced `crypto.tls` with `tls` in the package name.

This patch should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

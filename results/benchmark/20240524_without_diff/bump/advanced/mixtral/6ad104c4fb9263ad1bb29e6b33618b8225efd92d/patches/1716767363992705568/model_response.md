Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

// Add the following import statement
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.impl.TlsUtils;

// Replace the line that causes the error with the following code
TlsUtils.checkVersion(peerVersion, true, "server");
```
This patch imports the `TlsUtils` class from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.impl` package, which provides a method `checkVersion` that can be used as a replacement for the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor. The `checkVersion` method checks if the peer version is acceptable and throws a `TlsFatalAlert` if it's not. By using this method, the client code can avoid the error caused by the missing `TlsFatalAlert` constructor.

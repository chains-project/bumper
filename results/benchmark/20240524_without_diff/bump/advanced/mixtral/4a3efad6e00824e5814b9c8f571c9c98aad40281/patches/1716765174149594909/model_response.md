Here's the proposed patch:

Replace the following line:
```java
signatureParameters.setPermission(CertificationPermission.MINIMAL_CHANGES_PERMITTED);
```
with:
```java
signatureParameters.setPermission(eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.PAdESSignatureParameters.Permission.MINIMAL_CHANGES_PERMITTED);
```
The failure is caused by the missing import statement for `CertificationPermission`. However, instead of adding the import statement, it's better to use the fully qualified name for the enum value. This ensures that the code will work even if the import statement is not added or if the class is located in a different package.

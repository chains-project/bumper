Here's the proposed patch:

Replace the line with the error:
```java
signatureParameters.setPermission(CertificationPermission.MINIMAL_CHANGES_PERMITTED);
```
with:
```java
signatureParameters.setPermission(eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.PAdESSignatureParameters.Permission.MINIMAL_CHANGES_PERMITTED);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `CertificationPermission` cannot be found. This suggests that the import statement for this class is missing. However, it's possible that the class has been removed or renamed in a recent version of the library.

To fix the error, we can replace the usage of `CertificationPermission` with the fully qualified name of the equivalent constant in the `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.PAdESSignatureParameters.Permission` enum. This ensures that the code will still work even if the `CertificationPermission` class is not available.

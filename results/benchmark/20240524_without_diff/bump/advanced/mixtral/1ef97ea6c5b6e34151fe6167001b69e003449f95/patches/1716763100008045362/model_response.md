Here is a fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS).toEpochMilli();
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` cannot be directly converted to a `Timestamp` object. To fix this, we first convert the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object, and then convert the `Timestamp` object back to a `Date` object using the `toInstant()` method. We then truncate the resulting `Instant` object to the nearest millisecond using `truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS)`, and finally convert it back to a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch using `toEpochMilli()`. This `long` value can then be used to create a new `Timestamp` object.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change made is to fully qualify the types of the method parameters and return type to make it clear that we're using `java.sql.Timestamp` and `java.util.Date` instead of the raw types. This should resolve the incompatible types error.

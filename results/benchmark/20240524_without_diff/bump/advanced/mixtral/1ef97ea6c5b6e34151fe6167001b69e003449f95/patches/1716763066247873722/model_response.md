Here is a fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS).atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant();
}
```

This version converts the `Date` objects returned by `super.between` to `Timestamp` objects, and then converts the `Timestamp` objects to `Instant` objects. This allows us to use the `truncatedTo` method to truncate the `Instant` objects to the nearest millisecond, which is equivalent to rounding to the nearest millisecond. We then convert the truncated `Instant` objects back to `Timestamp` objects using the system default time zone.

Note that this version of the `between` method uses the `toInstant` and `atZone` methods, which are added in Java 8. If you are using an earlier version of Java, you will need to use a different approach.

Also note that this version of the `between` method may not produce the same results as the original version, depending on the implementation of the `DateAndTime` class and the behavior of the `truncatedTo` method. You should carefully test this version of the `between` method to ensure that it produces the desired results.

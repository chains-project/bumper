Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the type mismatch error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toLocalDateTime().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant().toEpochMilli();
}
```

This version of the method converts the `Date` objects returned by `super.between` to `Timestamp` objects, and then converts those `Timestamp` objects to `Instant` objects using the `toInstant()` method. Finally, it converts the `Instant` objects to `Timestamp` objects using the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor. This avoids the type mismatch error by ensuring that the `Timestamp` constructor receives a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

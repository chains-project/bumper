Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDateTime();
}
```

This fix converts the `Date` object returned by `super.between` to a `LocalDateTime` using the system default time zone before creating a new `Timestamp` object. This ensures that the returned `Timestamp` object is compatible with the method's return type.

Here's the fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

However, since the error message indicates that the `between` method of the superclass `DateAndTime` returns a `Date` object instead of a `Timestamp`, you need to convert the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` before returning it. Here's the updated version of the method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    Date date = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}
```

This updated version of the method first calls the `between` method of the superclass to get a `Date` object, and then converts it to a `Timestamp` using the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor. This constructor takes a `long` argument representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT and sets the time field of the new `Timestamp` object to the specified value.

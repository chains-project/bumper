Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The change in this patch is to explicitly specify the fully-qualified names of the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes from both `java.util` and `java.sql` packages. This is necessary because the `Date` class from `java.util` package cannot be converted to `Timestamp` class from `java.sql` package directly, as indicated by the error message.

By specifying the fully-qualified names, the code makes it clear which classes are being used, and the compiler can perform the necessary conversions between them.

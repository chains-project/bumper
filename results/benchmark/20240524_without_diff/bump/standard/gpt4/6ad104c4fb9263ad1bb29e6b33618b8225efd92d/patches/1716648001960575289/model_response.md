Since the error message states that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, it means that the package or library might have been removed or deprecated. 

In such cases, we need to find an alternative library or package that provides similar functionality. 

Unfortunately, without more context or information about the rest of the code, it's not possible to provide a specific code fix. 

However, an example of a possible fix could be to replace the import statement with an import statement for a different library that provides the required functionality. For example, if the `AlertDescription` class is available in a different package, the import statement could be changed to import from that package instead.

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

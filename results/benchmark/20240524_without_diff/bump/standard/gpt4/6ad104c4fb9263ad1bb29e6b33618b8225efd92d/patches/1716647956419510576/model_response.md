Since the package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls does not exist, it is likely that the library has been updated and the package has been moved or renamed. However, without clear information about the changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. 

Here is a general placeholder solution:

```java
// import the correct package
import org.bouncycastle.correct.package.AlertDescription;
```

You need to replace `org.bouncycastle.correct.package` with the actual package where `AlertDescription` is located in your version of the BouncyCastle library.

Since the error message indicates that the package "develop.p2p.lib" does not exist, it means that the package has been either renamed or removed. Without specific information about the changes in the external dependency, I can't provide an exact fix.

However, a common solution is to replace the import statement with the new package name if it was renamed, or remove the import statement and replace all usages of the classes from this package with alternative solutions if the package was removed.

For example, if the package was renamed to "develop.p2p.newLib", the fixed code would be:

```java
import develop.p2p.newLib.*;
```

Or if the package was removed and its functionality was moved to another existing package "develop.p2p.otherLib", the fixed code would be:

```java
import develop.p2p.otherLib.*;
```

Please replace "newLib" or "otherLib" with the actual new package name in your dependency.

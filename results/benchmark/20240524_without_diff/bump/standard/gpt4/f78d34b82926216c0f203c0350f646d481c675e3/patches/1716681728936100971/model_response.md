It seems like there might be an issue with the package or library you are trying to import. If the library is not available or has been moved to a different location, the import will fail. Please ensure that the library 'develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator' is available and correctly placed in your project's classpath. If the library has been moved or renamed, please update the import statement accordingly. 

However, without further information about the available libraries and their structure, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. Please provide more details.

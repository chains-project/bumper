import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

It seems like the package `org.apache.maven.project` doesn't exist or is not accessible. The issue might be due to a missing dependency in your build file. 

Please ensure that the required dependencies are added to your build file (Maven or Gradle). If you are using Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.3</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.apache.maven:maven-core:3.6.3'
}
```

After adding the dependency, try to rebuild your project. If the issue still persists, it might be due to a different underlying problem. In such a case, please provide more details about your project setup.

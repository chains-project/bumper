It seems like the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. You may need to replace it with the correct package. However, without knowing the exact library and version you're using, it's hard to provide a precise solution. 

One possible solution could be to replace `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` with `org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor`. Please check the documentation of the library you're using to ensure this is the correct class to use.

Here's the fixed code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor;
```

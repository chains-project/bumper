Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the call to the `assumeTrue` method with a direct method call to `Assume.assumeTrue`. This solution resolves the issue with the static import statement and allows the code to compile and run without errors.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The issue is caused by the use of the static method `Assume.assumeTrue()` which is not part of JUnit 5, but rather JUnit 4. To fix the issue, I have replaced the method with `assertTrue()` which has the same behavior and is part of JUnit 5.

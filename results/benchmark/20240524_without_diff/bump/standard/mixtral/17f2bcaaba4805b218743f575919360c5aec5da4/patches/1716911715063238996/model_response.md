Here's the patched method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

public void testMorphologyGroupShape() {
    Assume.assumeTrue(...);
    // rest of the method
}
```
Explanation:
The issue is caused by using a static import for a method, which is not allowed in Java. To fix this, we can replace the static import with an import for the class containing the method and then use the full class name to access the method. In this case, we replace `import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;` with `import org.junit.Assume;` and change `assumeTrue(...)` to `Assume.assumeTrue(...)`.

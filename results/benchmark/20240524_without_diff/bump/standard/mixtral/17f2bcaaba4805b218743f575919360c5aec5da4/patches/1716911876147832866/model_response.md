Here's the patched version of the code that should fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
The issue is caused by using a static import statement on a static method from a class. To fix this, we can simply remove the static import and directly call the method using the class name.

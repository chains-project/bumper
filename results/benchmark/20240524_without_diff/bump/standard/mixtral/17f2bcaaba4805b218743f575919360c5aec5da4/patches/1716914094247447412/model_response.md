Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this version, I've replaced the static import statement with a direct import of the `Assume` class, and then used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the compilation error.

Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this fixed version, I've replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the entire `org.junit.Assume` class. Then, I replaced the use of the static method `assumeTrue` with a direct invocation of the method on the imported class.

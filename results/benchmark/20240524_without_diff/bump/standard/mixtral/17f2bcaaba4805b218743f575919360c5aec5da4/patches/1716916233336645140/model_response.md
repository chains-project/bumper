Here's a fixed version of the `_radialWarp()` method:

```java
_radialWarp() {
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertTrue(GROUP == _SHAPE.getChildCount() && _SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS.createShape();
    _Morphology.radialWarp(GROUP, _SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

Changes made:

* Replaced `=` with `==` in the `assertTrue()` method call to fix the illegal character error.
* Added `createShape()` method call to create a new `processing.core.PShape` object, as the `micycle.pgs.PGS` class might not be a `processing.core.PShape` anymore.
* Updated the `radialWarp()` method call to fix the method signature and pass the required parameters.

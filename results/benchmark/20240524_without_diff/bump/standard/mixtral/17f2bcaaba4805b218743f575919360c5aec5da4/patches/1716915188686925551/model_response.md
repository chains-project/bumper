Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

The patch removes the static import statement and replaces it with an import statement for the `Assume` class, followed by using the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the error message and allow the code to compile successfully.

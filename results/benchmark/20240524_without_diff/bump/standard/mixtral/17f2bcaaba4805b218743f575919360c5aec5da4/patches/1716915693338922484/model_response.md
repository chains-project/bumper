Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The failure is caused by the use of the `org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue` method, which has been replaced by `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue` in JUnit 5. The code has been updated to use the new method. Additionally, the import statements have been updated to use the fully qualified names of the `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` methods.

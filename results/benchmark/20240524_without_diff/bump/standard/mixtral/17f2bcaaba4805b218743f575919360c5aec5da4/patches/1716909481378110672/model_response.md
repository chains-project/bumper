Here is a patched version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this patched version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and changed the usage of `assumeTrue` to use the fully-qualified class name. This should resolve the compilation error.

Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class and used the fully qualified class name to call the `assumeTrue` method.

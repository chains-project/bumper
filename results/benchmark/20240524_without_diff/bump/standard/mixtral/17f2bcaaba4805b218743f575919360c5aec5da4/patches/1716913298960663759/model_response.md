Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
Explanation:
The issue with the original code is that it uses a static import statement for a method from the `Assume` class. This is not allowed in Java, as static imports can only be used for classes and interfaces.

To fix this issue, we can remove the static import statement and directly use the `Assume` class, followed by the `assumeTrue` method. This way, we can avoid the error and make the code compile successfully.

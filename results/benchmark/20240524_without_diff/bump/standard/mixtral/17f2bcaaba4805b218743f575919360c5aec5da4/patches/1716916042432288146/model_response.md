Here is a fixed version of the `_radialWarp()` method:
```java
_radialWarp() {
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertTrue(GROUP == _SHAPE.getChildCount() && _SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS.createShape(micycle.pgs.PGS.GROUP);
    _Morphology.radialWarp(GROUP, _SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this version, I have made the following changes:

* Replaced the `=` operator with `==` in the `assertTrue()` method call to compare the values instead of assigning a value.
* Used the `createShape()` method of the `PGS` class to create a new `PShape` object with the correct group.
* Passed the `GROUP` variable as a separate argument to the `radialWarp()` method of the `_Morphology` class instead of assigning it to the `_SHAPE` object.

Note that the `GROUP` variable is not defined in the provided code, so you may need to define it appropriately in the client code.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I have replaced the `assumeTrue` method with the `assertTrue` method from the `Assertions` class. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error that is causing the test to fail.

I made this change because the `assumeTrue` method is used to indicate that a test should be skipped if the assumption is not true. However, in this case, the test should fail if the assumption is not true. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use the `assertTrue` method, which will cause the test to fail if the condition is not true.

I also imported the `assertTrue` method statically at the top of the file, so that it can be used without qualifying it with the `Assertions` class. This makes the code easier to read and write.

I did not change the function signature or use any removed library methods. I also did not add any new library methods, since the `Assertions` class is already part of the JUnit Jupiter library, which is already being used by the test.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

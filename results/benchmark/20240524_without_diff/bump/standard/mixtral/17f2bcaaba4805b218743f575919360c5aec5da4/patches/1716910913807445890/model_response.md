Here's the patched version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patched version, I have replaced the problematic static import statement with an explicit import for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the usage of the `assumeTrue` method with its fully qualified name. This solution addresses the error message by using a fully qualified method call instead of a static import.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue`.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, `Assume` is a class, but `assumeTrue` is a static method of that class. To fix the error, we can remove the static import and instead import the `Assume` class directly. Then, we can call `Assume.assumeTrue` instead of just `assumeTrue`. This will ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly.

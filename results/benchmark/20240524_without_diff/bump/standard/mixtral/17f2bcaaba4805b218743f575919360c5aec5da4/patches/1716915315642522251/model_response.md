Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an explicit import for the `Assume` class, and then used the `assumeTrue` method with the fully qualified name. This should resolve the error you encountered.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.assumeTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The issue was that the import for `assumeTrue` was missing. I added the following import:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.assumeTrue;
```

This import was missing in the original code, which led to the "cannot find symbol" error.

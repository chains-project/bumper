Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, we remove the static import and replace the usage of `assumeTrue` with its fully qualified name. This solution ensures that the code will compile and run without any issues related to the import statement.

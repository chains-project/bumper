Here's a fixed version of the client code that removes the failing static import statement:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, we remove the static import statement and use the fully qualified name `Assume` instead. This way, there's no need for a static import, and the code should compile and run without issues.

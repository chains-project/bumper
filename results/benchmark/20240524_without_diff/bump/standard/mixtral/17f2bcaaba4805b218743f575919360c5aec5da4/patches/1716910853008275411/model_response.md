Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the problematic static import statement with an import for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the use of the `assumeTrue` method with its fully qualified name.

You can replace the comment `/* your condition here */` with the actual condition you want to check.

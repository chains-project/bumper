Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the error message you were seeing.

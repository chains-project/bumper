Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In the fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an explicit import of the `Assume` class. Instead of using the static method through the import statement, I use it by calling `Assume.assumeTrue()`.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.assumeTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2, "GROUP_SHAPE should have 2 children");
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount(), "Buffer of GROUP_SHAPE should have 2 children");
}
```

The error is caused because the `Assume` class is not being imported. I've imported the `assumeTrue` method from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions` and renamed the original variable to make it clear that it's an assumption, not an assertion. Also, added a message to the `assertEquals` method for better error reporting.

Here's the patched version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

//...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
The issue with the original code is the usage of a static import statement for a method. Instead, we can directly reference the method by using its fully qualified name. This will resolve the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
In this fixed version, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then used the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method in the code. This should resolve the error message about static import only being allowed for classes and interfaces.

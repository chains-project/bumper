Here's the proposed patch for the given client code:

```java
_radialWarp() {
    boolean groupChildrenEqualTwo = GROUP.getChildCount() == 2;
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertTrue(groupChildrenEqualTwo);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS;
    _Morphology.radialWarp(GROUP, 10, 1, false);
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch fixes the illegal character error by removing the unnecessary assignment in the `assertTrue` statement. It also declares a new variable `groupChildrenEqualTwo` to make the code more readable.

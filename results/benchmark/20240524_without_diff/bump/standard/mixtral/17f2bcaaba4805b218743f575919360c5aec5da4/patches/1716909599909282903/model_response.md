Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

This patch replaces the problematic static import statement with an explicit import for the `Assume` class, and then uses the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This should resolve the compilation error caused by the static import.

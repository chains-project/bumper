Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
The patch replaces the problematic static import statement with an import for the `Assume` class. Then, instead of using the static method with the static import, we use the fully qualified name of the class and its method.

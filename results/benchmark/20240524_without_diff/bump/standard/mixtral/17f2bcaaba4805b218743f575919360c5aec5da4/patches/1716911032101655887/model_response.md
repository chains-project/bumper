Here is a potential patch for the code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The change I made is to replace `org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue` with `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue`. The `assumeTrue` method is used to check a condition and skip the test if the condition is not met, while the `assertTrue` method is used to check that a condition is true and fail the test if it is not.

In this case, it seems that the `assumeTrue` method is not being found, so I replaced it with `assertTrue` which should be available in the `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` class.

Additionally, I imported the `assertTrue` method statically to make the code cleaner.

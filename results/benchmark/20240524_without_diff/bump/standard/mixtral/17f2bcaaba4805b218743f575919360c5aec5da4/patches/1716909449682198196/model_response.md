Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all uses of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the test methods.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is a class, not an interface. Therefore, we need to remove the static import and instead use the fully qualified name of the `Assume` class.

Additionally, we need to update any calls to `assumeTrue` to use the fully qualified name of the method. This is because the static import is no longer present, so the method name needs to be qualified with the class name.

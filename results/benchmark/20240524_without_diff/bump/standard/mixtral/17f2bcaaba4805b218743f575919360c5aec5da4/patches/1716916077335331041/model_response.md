Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
_radialWarp() {
    boolean assertionResult = micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertTrue(_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS;
    _Morphology.radialWarp(_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    int childCount = out.getChildCount();
    micycle.pgs.Assertions.assertEquals(2, childCount);
}
```

The issue was caused by the use of the `GROUP` identifier as a variable name, which is not allowed because it contains an illegal character `'` in Java. I have replaced it with a more appropriate variable name `out`. Additionally, I have created a new variable `assertionResult` to store the result of the `assertTrue` method call, as the original code was using the assignment operator `=` instead of the equality operator `==`.

Here's the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the entire `org.junit.Assume` class. Then, I replaced the use of the static method `assumeTrue` with a direct invocation of the method on the `Assume` class.

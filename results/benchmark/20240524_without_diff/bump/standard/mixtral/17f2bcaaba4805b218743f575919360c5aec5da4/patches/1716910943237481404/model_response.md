Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, the class `Assume` needs to be imported directly instead of using a static import.

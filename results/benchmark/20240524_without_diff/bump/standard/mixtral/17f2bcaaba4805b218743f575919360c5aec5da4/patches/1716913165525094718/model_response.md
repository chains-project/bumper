Here's the patched version of the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patched version, I replaced the static import with an explicit import of the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the usage of the static method `assumeTrue` with the fully qualified class name `Assume.assumeTrue`.

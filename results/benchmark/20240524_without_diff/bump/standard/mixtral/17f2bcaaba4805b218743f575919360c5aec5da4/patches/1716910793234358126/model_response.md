Here's the patched version of the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert;

// ...

public void testSomething() {
    assumeTrue(someCondition());
    // ...
}

// ...

private boolean someCondition() {
    // ...
    return someValue;
}
```
In this patched version, I replaced the problematic static import statement with an equivalent statement using the `Assert` class from JUnit. Additionally, I added a dummy method `someCondition()` that can be used in place of the `assumeTrue()` method. You can replace the implementation of `someCondition()` according to your testing needs.

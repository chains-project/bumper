Here's the fixed version of the failing method:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
The issue with the original code is that it uses a static import statement for a method, which is not allowed. Instead, you should use the normal import statement for the class and call the method directly on the class. In this case, I replaced the static import statement with the normal import statement for the `Assume` class and called the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class.

Here is the fixed version of the code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```
In this fixed version, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then qualified the `assumeTrue` method call with the `Assume` class name. This way, the code should compile and run correctly.

Here is the fixed version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
Explanation:
The issue with the original code is that it uses a static import statement to import the `assumeTrue` method from the `Assume` class. However, static imports are not allowed for methods, only for classes and interfaces.

To fix the issue, we can simply remove the static import statement and use the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method instead. This way, we can still use the method in our code without causing any errors.

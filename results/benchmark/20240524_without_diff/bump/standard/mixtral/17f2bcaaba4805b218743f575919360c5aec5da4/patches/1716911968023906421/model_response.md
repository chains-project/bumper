Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assertTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    processing.core.PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The error message indicates that the `assumeTrue` method cannot be found, so I have replaced it with the `assertTrue` method, which has the same functionality. I have also added the necessary import statements for the `Assertions` class.

Here's the patched version of the client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patched version, I've replaced the static import with an explicit import of the `Assume` class and used the class name to call the `assumeTrue` method. This should resolve the compilation error.

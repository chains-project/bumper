Here's the patched version of the client code that should fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
In this patched version, I removed the static import statement and replaced it with the full class name for the `assumeTrue` method. This way, the code will not rely on a static import and will not produce the reported error.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(...);
```

In this patch, I have replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I have used the `Assume.assumeTrue` method directly. This should resolve the error message related to static import only from classes and interfaces.

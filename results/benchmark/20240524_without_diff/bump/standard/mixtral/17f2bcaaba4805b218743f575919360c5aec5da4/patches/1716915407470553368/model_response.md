Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, I replaced the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method call with the fully qualified name `Assume.assumeTrue`. This ensures that the `assumeTrue` method is called from the imported `Assume` class, resolving the error.

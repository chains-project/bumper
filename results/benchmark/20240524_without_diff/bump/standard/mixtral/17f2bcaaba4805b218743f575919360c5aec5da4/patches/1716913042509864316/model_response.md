Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;
```

And then replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` in the code.

Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is a class. Therefore, we can simply remove the static import and directly use the `Assume` class instead. We replace all instances of `assumeTrue` with `Assume.assumeTrue` to ensure that the code still functions as intended.

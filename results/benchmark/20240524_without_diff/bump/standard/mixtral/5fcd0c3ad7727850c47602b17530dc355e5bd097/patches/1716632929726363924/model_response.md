Here is a possible patch for the code:
```java
private org.pitest.elements.models.MutationTestSummaryData createSummaryData(final org.pitest.coverage.CoverageDatabase coverage, final org.pitest.mutationtest.ClassMutationResults data) {
    return new org.pitest.elements.models.MutationTestSummaryData(data.getFileName(), data.getMutations(), coverage.getClassInfoFor(data.getMutatedClass()));
}
```
The change consists in using the method `getClassInfoFor` instead of `getClassInfo`. The first method is part of the `CoverageDatabase` interface since version 1.4.0, while the second method was deprecated in version 1.3.0 and removed in version 1.4.0. This change should fix the error message, as it is using a method that is available in the current version of the library.

Here is a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```
Note that I only changed the package name from `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` to `org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls`. This is because the error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist.

By changing the package name to `org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls`, the client code should be able to import the `TlsFatalAlert` class from the Bouncy Castle library.

However, it's important to note that this patch assumes that the Bouncy Castle library is available on the classpath. If the library is not available, the client code will still fail to compile or run. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that the library is properly installed and configured before applying this patch.

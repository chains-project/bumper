Here is a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note: It seems that there is a typo in the package name in the original code. The correct package name for Bouncy Castle TLS API is `org.bouncecastle` instead of `org.bouncycastle`. The proposed patch corrects this typo.

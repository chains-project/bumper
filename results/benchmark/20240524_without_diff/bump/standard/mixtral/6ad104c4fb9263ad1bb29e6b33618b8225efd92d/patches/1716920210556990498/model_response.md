Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note that the package import statement has been changed to use the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class, which should resolve the error message.

Also, I noticed that the error message mentioned that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. However, the original client code was trying to import `AlertDescription` from the same package. Therefore, I assumed that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` exists, and only the import statement needs to be corrected. If this assumption is incorrect, please provide more information about the external dependency and its version, so I can give a more accurate patch.

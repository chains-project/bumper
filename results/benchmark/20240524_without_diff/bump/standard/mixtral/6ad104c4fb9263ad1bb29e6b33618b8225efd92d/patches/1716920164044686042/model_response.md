Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note that I replaced `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` with `org.bouncycastle.tls`. This should fix the error message you encountered.

The reason for this failure is that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, which is causing the compilation error. By changing the import statement to `org.bouncycastle.tls`, we can import the correct package and fix the error.

Additionally, I would like to note that the class `AlertDescription` is available in both `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` and `org.bouncycastle.tls` packages. Therefore, it's possible that the original code was intended to import from the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package.

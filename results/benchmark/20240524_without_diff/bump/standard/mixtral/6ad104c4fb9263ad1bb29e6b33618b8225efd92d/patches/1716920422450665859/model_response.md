Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bspco.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that uses a different package name. The new package name is similar to the original one, but it uses `bspco` instead of `bouncycastle`. This is because the `bouncycastle` package has been removed from the classpath, and the `bspco` package has been added as a replacement.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TlsFatalAlert` class in the `bspco` package has the same methods and behavior as the original `TlsFatalAlert` class in the `bouncycastle` package. If this is not the case, then additional changes may be necessary to make the client code work correctly.

Here's a fixed version of the client code that replaces the failing import statement:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```
Note that I replaced `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` with `org.bouncycastle.tls`. This is because the `crypto` package was removed in a dependency update, and the `tls` package was moved to a different location. The `TlsFatalAlert` class still exists in the `tls` package, so we can safely import it from there.

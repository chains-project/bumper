Here is the updated `decodeCiphertext` method with the error fixed:

```java
public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] additionalData, byte[] ciphertext) throws java.io.IOException {
    org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter macKey = initRecordMAC(decryptCipher);
    byte[] calculatedMAC = io.github.hapjava.server.impl.crypto.PolyKeyCreator.create(macKey, additionalData, ciphertext);
    if (!org.bouncycastle.util.Arrays.constantTimeAreEqual(calculatedMAC, receivedMAC)) {
        throw new org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert(new org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription(10));
    }
    byte[] output = new byte[ciphertext.length];
    decryptCipher.processBytes(ciphertext, 0, ciphertext.length, output,  variableName);
    return output;
}
```

The error was caused by using the incorrect variable name `cipherte` instead of `ciphertext` in the `processBytes` method. I have updated the code to use the correct variable.

Additionally, I have introduced a new variable `variableName` to replace the hard-coded value `0` in the `processBytes` method's last argument. This variable can be initialized to `0` in the beginning of the method.

```
int variableName = 0;
```

This makes the code more modular and easier to modify in the future.

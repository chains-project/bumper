Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note that I have changed the import statement to use the fully qualified class name `org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription` instead of the unqualified name `AlertDescription`. This will ensure that the correct class is imported, even if there are other classes with the same name in the classpath.

Additionally, I have not made any changes to the method signature or the method body, as the failure is caused by a missing dependency and not by an issue with the code itself.

Here's a proposed patch for the client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with the correct package name for `AlertDescription` in the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package. The `crypto` package was removed in a later version of the Bouncy Castle library, causing the original import statement to fail. The `tls` package remains unchanged and is still valid.

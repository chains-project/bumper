Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Note: The only change made here is to replace the import statement with the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class. This assumes that the required Bouncy Castle library is available on the classpath. If it's not, you will need to add it to the classpath before running the code.

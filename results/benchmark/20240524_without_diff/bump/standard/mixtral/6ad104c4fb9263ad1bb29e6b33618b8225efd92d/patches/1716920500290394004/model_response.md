Here's a possible patch for the code you provided. Since the error message indicates that the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package does not exist, it seems like the Bouncy Castle library is not available or not properly imported.

To fix this issue, you can use the `Java NIO TLS` library instead. Specifically, you can use the `javax.net.ssl` package to handle TLS connections. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use this package:
```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.NotYetConnectedException;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    private SSLEngine sslEngine;
    private AsynchronousSocketChannel socketChannel;
    private ByteBuffer inputBuffer;
    private ByteBuffer outputBuffer;

    public ChachaDecoder(SSLEngine sslEngine, AsynchronousSocketChannel socketChannel) {
        this.sslEngine = sslEngine;
        this.socketChannel = socketChannel;
        this.inputBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(4096);
        this.outputBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(4096);
    }

    public void decode(ByteBuffer buffer) throws SSLException, IOException, ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        while (true) {
            try {
                // Handle any available data in the input buffer
                if (inputBuffer.position() > 0) {
                    int bytesProcessed = sslEngine.wrap(inputBuffer, outputBuffer);
                    inputBuffer.compact();
                    outputBuffer.flip();
                    socketChannel.write(outputBuffer);
                    outputBuffer.compact();
                    if (bytesProcessed < inputBuffer.remaining()) {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                // Read data from the socket channel
                inputBuffer.clear();
                int bytesRead = socketChannel.read(inputBuffer);
                if (bytesRead <= 0) {
                    throw new ClosedChannelException();
                }
                inputBuffer.flip();
            } catch (NotYetConnectedException e) {
                // Handle the case where the socket channel is not yet connected
                // (e.g., by waiting for the connection to be established)
                socketChannel.finishConnect();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this code uses the `SSLEngine` class from the `javax.net.ssl` package to handle TLS connections. This class provides a high-level API for SSL/TLS communication, and can be used to secure network connections.

In addition, this code uses the `AsynchronousSocketChannel` class from the `java.nio.channels` package to read and write data to the socket. This class provides a non-blocking I/O API for socket communication, which can be more efficient than the traditional blocking I/O model.

Overall, this code should provide a functional replacement for the original code that uses the Bouncy Castle library. However, note that there may be some differences in behavior or performance between the two libraries, so you may need to test and adjust the code to fit your specific use case.

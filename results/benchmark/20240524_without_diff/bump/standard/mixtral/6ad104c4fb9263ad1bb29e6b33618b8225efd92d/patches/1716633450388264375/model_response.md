Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note that I have changed the import statement to use the fully qualified name of the `AlertDescription` class, which should resolve the "package not found" error.

However, please note that this patch assumes that the required Bouncy Castle library is correctly installed and available on the classpath of your project. If the library is not present or not correctly configured, you may still encounter errors or exceptions when running the code.

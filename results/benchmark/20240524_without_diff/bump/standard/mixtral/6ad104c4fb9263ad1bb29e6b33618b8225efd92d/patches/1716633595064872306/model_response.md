Here's a possible patch for the given client code. Since the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package is not available, I will replace it with `de.raysha.lib.jsr305.gwt.crypto.tls` package, which provides similar functionality.

Please note that this might not be a perfect replacement, but it should fix the compilation error.

```java
import de.raysha.lib.jsr305.gwt.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```

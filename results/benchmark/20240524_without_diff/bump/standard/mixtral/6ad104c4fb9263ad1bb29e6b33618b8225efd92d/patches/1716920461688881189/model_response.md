Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.ChaChaEngine;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.BlockCipher;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    private BlockCipher engine;

    public ChachaDecoder(byte[] key, byte[] iv) {
        engine = new ChaChaEngine();
        KeyParameter keyParam = new KeyParameter(key);
        engine.init(true, keyParam, iv);
    }

    public int decode(ByteBuffer src, ByteBuffer dst) {
        byte[] in = new byte[src.remaining()];
        src.get(in);

        byte[] out = new byte[dst.remaining()];
        int length = engine.processBytes(in, 0, in.length, out, 0);

        dst.put(out, 0, length);

        return length;
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the missing `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package with the equivalent classes from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto` package. Specifically, I replaced the `TlsFatalAlert` class with a `ChaChaEngine` engine, which can be used to perform the same encryption/decryption operations.

Note that this patch may not be a drop-in replacement for the original code, as the behavior of the `ChaChaEngine` engine may differ slightly from the original `TlsFatalAlert` class. However, it should provide a starting point for fixing the missing dependency issue.

Here is a potential patch for the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.engines.ChaChaEngine;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.ParametersWithIV;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // existing code

    private void decode(byte[] input, byte[] output) {
        ChaChaEngine engine = new ChaChaEngine();
        KeyParameter keyParam = new KeyParameter(key.getBytes());
        engine.init(true, new ParametersWithIV(keyParam, nonce));
        engine.processBytes(input, 0, input.length, output, 0);
    }
}
```
Note that this patch removes the dependency on the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package and instead uses the `org.bouncycastle.crypto` package to implement the ChaCha decoding logic. This should fix the "package does not exist" error. However, it's possible that this patch may cause other issues if the rest of the code relies on the `TlsFatalAlert` class or other classes in the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package. In that case, you may need to find a different solution or contact the library maintainers for assistance.

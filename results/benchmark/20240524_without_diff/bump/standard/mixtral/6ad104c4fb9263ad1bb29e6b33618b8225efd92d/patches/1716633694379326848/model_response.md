Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note that the import statement has been changed to use the fully qualified class name `org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription` instead of `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription`. This is because the `crypto` package has been removed from the Bouncy Castle library, and the `tls` package should be used instead.

Additionally, it's important to note that the `AlertDescription` class has not been removed or deprecated, it has just been moved to a different package. Therefore, the code that uses this class should continue to work as long as the correct import statement is used.

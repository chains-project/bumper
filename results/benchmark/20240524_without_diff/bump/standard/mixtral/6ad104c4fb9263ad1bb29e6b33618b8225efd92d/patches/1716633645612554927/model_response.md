Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Note: The only change made is to replace `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` with `org.bouncycastle.tls` in the import statement. This assumes that the required library is present in the project's classpath. If it's not, the library will need to be added to the project for this code to work.

Here's a proposed patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

Note: Since the error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist, I'm assuming that the package `org.bouncycastle.tls` exists and contains the class `AlertDescription`. Therefore, I've changed the import statement to import `AlertDescription` from `org.bouncycastle.tls` instead of `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls`.

Here is a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.bouncecastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Note: It looks like there is a typo in the import statement of the given client code. It should be "org.bouncecastle" instead of "org.bouncycastle". The rest of the code should work as expected once this typo is fixed.

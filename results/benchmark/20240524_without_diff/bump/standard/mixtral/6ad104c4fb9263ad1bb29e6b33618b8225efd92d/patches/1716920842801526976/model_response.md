Here's a patched version of the failing method that removes the problematic import statement:
```java
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.security.GeneralSecurityException;
import java.util.Arrays;

import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.CipherInputStream;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // ... other code ...

    private byte[] decryptChacha20Poly1305(byte[] ciphertext, byte[] key, byte[] iv) throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {
        // ... other code ...
    }

    // ... other code ...
}
```
Note that this patch removes the problematic import statement, but does not replace it with a different one. This is because the original import statement was not actually used in the method. If the import statement is needed elsewhere in the class, it should be added back in, but only after verifying that the required library is available in the project's dependencies.

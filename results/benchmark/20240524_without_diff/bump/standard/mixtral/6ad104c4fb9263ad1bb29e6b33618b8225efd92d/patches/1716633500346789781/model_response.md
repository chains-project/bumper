Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This means that the client code is trying to import a class from a package that is not available in the classpath.
To fix this error, we can replace the incorrect import statement with the correct one.
In this case, the class `AlertDescription` is actually located in the package `org.bouncycastle.tls`, not `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls`.
Therefore, we can replace the incorrect import statement with the correct one, as shown in the patch.
Note that this patch assumes that the Bouncy Castle library is already added to the project's dependencies, and that the library version contains the `AlertDescription` class in the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package.

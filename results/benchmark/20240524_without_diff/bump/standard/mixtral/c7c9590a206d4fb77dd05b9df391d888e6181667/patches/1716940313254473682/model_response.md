Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
```
Explanation:
The original import statement is trying to import a class from the `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render` package, but the error message indicates that the package does not exist.
To fix the error, I propose changing the import statement to import the `RenderingContext` class from the `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer` package instead, which is a valid package in the Maven Doxia project.
This change should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@java.lang.Override
public com.artipie.security.policy.Policy<?> getPolicy(final com.artipie.security.policy.PolicyConfig config) {
    final com.artipie.security.policy.PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    final com.artipie.asto.Storage storage = new com.artipie.security.policy.SimpleStorageFactory().newStorage(sub.string("type"), com.amihaiemil.eoyaml.Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping());
    try {
        return new com.artipie.security.policy.YamlPolicy(new com.artipie.asto.blocking.BlockingStorage(storage));
    } catch (final java.io.IOException err) {
        throw new java.io.UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the class `Storages` cannot be found. This class might have been removed or renamed in a recent dependency update. To fix the error, I have replaced the usage of `Storages` with a different class `SimpleStorageFactory` that provides similar functionality. I have also simplified the creation of the `Storage` object by using the `newStorage` method of `SimpleStorageFactory` instead of the `newStorage` method of `Storages`. This patch should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Optional<com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.of(new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.AnonymousUser("alice"));
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `User` class with `AnonymousUser` class, which is a subclass of `User` and is available in the same package. This should resolve the compilation error.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@Override
public Optional<com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.of(new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.Anonymous("alice"));
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User` with `com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.Anonymous`. The `Anonymous` class is a subtype of `User`, so it should be a valid replacement.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Optional` class is imported as `java.util.Optional`. If it's not, you may need to add the import statement at the top of your file.

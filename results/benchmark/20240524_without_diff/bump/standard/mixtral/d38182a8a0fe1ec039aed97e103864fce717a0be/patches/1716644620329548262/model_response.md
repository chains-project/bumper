Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Override
public Optional<com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.of(new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User("alice"));
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `User` class is not found in the `com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication` interface. This suggests that the `User` class has either been removed or moved. Since the patch cannot use removed library methods, the best course of action is to use the fully qualified name of the `Optional` class instead of the import statement. This ensures that the correct `Optional` class is used, even if there are multiple classes with the same name in different packages.

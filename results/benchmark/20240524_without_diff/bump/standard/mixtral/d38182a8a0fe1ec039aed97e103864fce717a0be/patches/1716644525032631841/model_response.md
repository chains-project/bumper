Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Override
public Optional<com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.of(new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.AnonymousUser());
}
```
This patch uses the `AnonymousUser` class provided by the `com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication` interface, which should be available even if the `User` class is not. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

It is worth noting that using an anonymous user may not be appropriate for all use cases, and it may be necessary to modify the code further to meet the specific requirements of the application. However, this patch should at least allow the code to compile and run, which should make it easier to diagnose and fix any additional issues that may arise.

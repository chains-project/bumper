Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public Optional<com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User> user() {
    return java.util.Optional.of(new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.AnonymousUser("alice"));
}
```

This patch replaces the `com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User` class with `com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.AnonymousUser`, since the former is not found in the error message. This assumes that the `AnonymousUser` class has a constructor that takes a `String` argument, as in the original code.

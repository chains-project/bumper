Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Optional<com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.of(new com.artipie.http.auth.Authentication.User("alice"));
}
```

The only change made is to replace `java.util.Optional` with `Optional`, which is a shorthand for `java.util.Optional` in the current context. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error for the `User` class.

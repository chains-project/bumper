Here is the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import java.util.Objects;

// ...

if (isNull(jfrogInstance)) {
    // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The original code imports the `isNull` method from `java.util.Objects` using a static import statement. However, this syntax is not supported in Java. Instead, you can import the `java.util.Objects` class and call the `isNull` method using the fully qualified name.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import java.util.Objects;

// ...

if (isNull(jfrogInstance)) {
    // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The issue with the original code is that it is trying to import a static method from `java.util.Objects` using the static import syntax, but it is missing the class name before the method name. The correct syntax should be `Objects.isNull(jfrogInstance)`.

To fix the issue, I have imported the `java.util.Objects` class and used its `isNull` method directly. This should resolve the compilation error.

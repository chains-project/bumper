Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import java.util.Objects;

// ...

if (isNull(jfrogInstance)) {
    // ...
}
```

The patch imports the `Objects` class instead of using a static import for `Objects.isNull()`. This allows the `isNull()` method to be called directly on the `Objects` class.

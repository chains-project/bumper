Here is a fixed version of the client code:
```java
import java.util.Objects;

// ...

if (isNull(jfrogInstance)) {
    // ...
}
```
In this fixed version, I imported the `Objects` class instead of the static method `Objects.isNull()`. This is because the `isNull` method is a static method of the `Objects` class, and it can't be imported directly using a static import statement.

Instead, you should import the `Objects` class and then call the `isNull` method using the fully qualified name `Objects.isNull()`. This way, the code will compile and run correctly.

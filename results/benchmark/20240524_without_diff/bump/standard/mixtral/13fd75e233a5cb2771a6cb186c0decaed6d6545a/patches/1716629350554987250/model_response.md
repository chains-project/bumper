Here is a potential patch for the given code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
The failure in the original code is caused by passing two arguments to the `StringContains` constructor, when it only expects one. The updated code uses the `containsString` method from the `Matchers` class instead, which only requires a single argument. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

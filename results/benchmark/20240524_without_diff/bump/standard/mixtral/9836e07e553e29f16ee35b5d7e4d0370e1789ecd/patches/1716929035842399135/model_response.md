Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
private static com.artipie.http.hm.ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    org.hamcrest.Matcher<String> startsWithMatcher = new org.hamcrest.core.StringStartsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/");
    return new com.artipie.http.hm.ResponseMatcher(com.artipie.http.rs.RsStatus.ACCEPTED, new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Location", startsWithMatcher), new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Range", "0-0"), new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"), new com.artipie.http.hm.IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", org.hamcrest.Matchers.not(org.hamcrest.Matchers.emptyString())));
}
```
In this patch, I created a new `Matcher` variable `startsWithMatcher` that wraps the `StringStartsWith` matcher with the appropriate arguments. Then, I used this new variable in the `IsHeader` constructor for the "Location" header.

Additionally, I replaced the use of `IsNot<>(org.hamcrest.Matchers.emptyString())` with `not(org.hamcrest.Matchers.emptyString())` in the `IsHeader` constructor for the "Docker-Upload-UUID" header. This is because `IsNot` is marked as `--` in the prompt, indicating that it is a removed library method. Instead, I used the `not` method from Hamcrest, which is an alternative way to express a negative matcher.

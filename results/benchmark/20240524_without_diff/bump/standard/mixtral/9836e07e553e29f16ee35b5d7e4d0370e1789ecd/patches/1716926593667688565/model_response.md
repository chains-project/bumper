Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> layersPushed() {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("%s: Pushed", this.image.layer()));
}
```
The patch removes the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, which is causing the compilation error. This argument was added in a later version of Hamcrest, and is not compatible with the version used by the client code. By removing it, the code can compile and run successfully.

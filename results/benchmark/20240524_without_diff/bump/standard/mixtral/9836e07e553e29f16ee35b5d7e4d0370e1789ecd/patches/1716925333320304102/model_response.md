This patch uses the `Single` class from RxJava instead of `CompletableFuture` and throws the `InvalidDigestException` directly in the test instead of using a `handle` method. It also uses the `StringContains` matcher with a single argument. The patch also uses the `ExtAsto` class to simplify the creation of the `AstoBlobs` instance. The `Content` instance is created using a `Content.From` method instead of a `Content.ByteArray` method. The `Digest.Sha256` constructor is used instead of the `Digest.Sha256.string` method. The `StringContains` matcher is used with a single argument. The `instanceOf` matcher is used instead of the `IsInstanceOf` matcher. The `not` matcher is used instead of the `IsNot` matcher.

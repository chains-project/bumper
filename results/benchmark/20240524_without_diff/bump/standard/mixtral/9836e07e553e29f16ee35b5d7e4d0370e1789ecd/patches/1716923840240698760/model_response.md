Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the constructor of `StringContains` is expecting a single argument of type `String`, but it is receiving two arguments: a `boolean` and a `String`.
This suggests that the call to the constructor is passing an extra argument, which is not needed.
To fix this, we can remove the first argument (the `false` value), and keep only the second argument (the formatted string).
This will ensure that the constructor receives a single `String` argument, as expected.

Here's the patched method that should fix the error:
```java
private org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> manifestPushed() {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("latest: digest: %s", this.image.digest()));
}
```
In this patch, I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it's not needed and is causing the constructor mismatch error.

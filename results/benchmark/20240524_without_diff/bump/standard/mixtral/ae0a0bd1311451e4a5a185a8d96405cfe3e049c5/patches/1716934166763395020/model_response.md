Here's a fixed version of the code that should resolve the error:

```java
@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void shouldPullPushedByDigest() throws java.lang.Exception {
    this.client.run("push", this.image.remote());
    this.client.run("image", "rm", this.image.name());
    this.client.run("image", "rm", this.image.remote());
    final java.lang.String output = this.client.run("pull", this.image.remoteByDigest());
    boolean contains = output.contains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", this.image.remoteByDigest()));
    org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains("Status: Downloaded newer image for " + this.image.remoteByDigest()));
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertFalse(contains);
}
```

In this version, I created a new variable `contains` that stores the result of the `output.contains` method. Then, I used the `StringContains` matcher with the expected value, which is a string that includes the digest of the image.

Finally, I added a new assertion to ensure that the `output` does not contain the string indicating that a newer image was downloaded. This is because the test expects that the image was already present and did not need to be downloaded.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
void shouldThrowExceptionOnInvalidPath() {
    org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows(java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new com.artipie.docker.http.UploadEntity.Request(new com.artipie.http.rq.RequestLine(RqMethod.PUT, "/one/two").toString())).getName(), new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains("Unexpected path"));
}
```
The failure is caused by the incorrect usage of `StringContains` matcher. It expects a single string argument, but it was called with two arguments. To fix the issue, I replaced the second argument `false` with the expected substring `"Unexpected path"`. Additionally, I replaced the `getMessage()` method with `getName()` method in the `UploadEntity.Request` object, as it seems to be the correct method to get the name of the exception.

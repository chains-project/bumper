Here is a potential patch for the code:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `StringContains` constructor is being called with two arguments, but it only expects one. The patch removes the `false` argument, which was not being used for anything in the original code.

It's worth noting that the `StringContains` constructor can also be called with a `CoreMatchers.containsString()` method instead of a plain string, which might make the code more readable. Here is an example of how that could look:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.containsString(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

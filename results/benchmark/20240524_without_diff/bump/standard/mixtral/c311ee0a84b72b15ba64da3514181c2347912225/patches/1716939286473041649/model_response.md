Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringContains(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```

In this patch, I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor. This argument was causing a compilation error because it was not present in the original constructor signature. By removing it, the code should compile and run successfully.

Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method. The issue is caused by a change in the type of the `registry` field in the `DefaultMOServer` class. In the newer version, it's a `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOScope>>` instead of `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`. To fix this, we need to change the type of the `reg` variable accordingly.

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOScope>> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<MOScope>>) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

In this patch, I added a type cast to the `reg` variable to suppress the warning. The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is used to indicate that we are aware of the potential issue and are choosing to ignore it.

Additionally, I added a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block since it's possible that the cast might fail if the new version of the library doesn't have the same type for the `registry` field.

This patch should fix the compilation error and allow the code to run with the new version of the library. However, it's important to note that this solution is not ideal since it relies on reflection and type casting. It would be better to update the code to use the new API provided by the library if possible.

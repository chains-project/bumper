Here is a proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

The patch modifies the second argument of the `extractFirst` method from `JsonBranch` to `Object`. This is because the error message suggests that the `JsonBranch` class cannot be found. By changing the argument type to `Object`, the method can still accept instances of `JsonBranch`, but it will also be able to accept any other object type. This should allow the method to be called without causing a compile error. However, it's important to note that this patch may cause a runtime error if an incompatible object type is passed to the method. It would be better to fix the underlying issue with the `JsonBranch` class rather than relying on this workaround.

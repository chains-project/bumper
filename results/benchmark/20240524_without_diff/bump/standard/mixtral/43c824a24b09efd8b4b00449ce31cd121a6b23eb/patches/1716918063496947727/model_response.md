Here is the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `JsonBranch` type of the `branch` parameter with `Object`. This is because the error message suggests that the `JsonBranch` class cannot be found, which means it may have been removed or renamed in the external dependency. By using `Object` instead, we can avoid relying on the missing class and still allow the method to accept any object as input.

Note that this patch assumes that the `extractList` method of `MarcFactory` can handle an `Object` type for the `branch` parameter. If this is not the case, additional changes may be necessary.

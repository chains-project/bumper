Here is a possible patch for the `registerHard` method:

```java
    private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);
            Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = new TreeMap<>(server.getRegistry());
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
 }
}
```

I made the following changes:

* I replaced the `SortedMap` type with `Map` for the `reg` variable. This is because the `put` method of `SortedMap` has a different return type (`V` instead of `void`) than the `put` method of `Map`.
* I created a new `TreeMap` from the `reg` variable before setting it as the new value for the `registry` field. This is because the `set` method of the `Field` class expects an object of the same type as the field.

These changes should fix the type compatibility issue reported in the error message.

Note that these changes may not be sufficient if the order of the entries in the registry is important. In that case, you may need to use a different approach to preserve the order of the entries.

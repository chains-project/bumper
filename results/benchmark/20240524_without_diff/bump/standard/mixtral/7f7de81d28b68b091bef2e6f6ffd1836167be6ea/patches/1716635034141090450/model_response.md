Here is a possible patch for the `registerHard` method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        final Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = new TreeMap<>(server.getRegistry());
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
   
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

This patch creates a new `TreeMap` from the `registry` and puts the new `MOGroup` into it. It then sets the new `TreeMap` to the `registry`.

This should fix the type compatibility issue because `SortedMap` is a generic interface and it cannot be instantiated directly.

Note that this patch uses the `TreeMap` class which is a part of the standard Java library and it was added in Java 1.2. It is available in the version of Java that you are using.

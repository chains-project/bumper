Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method. The issue seems to be caused by a type mismatch in the SortedMap. I'm assuming that the new version of the external dependency has changed the type of the values in the SortedMap from `ManagedObject` to `ManagedObject<?>`.

To fix this, you can change the type of the `reg` variable to `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>` and update the type of the value being put into the map accordingly.
```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```
Note that this patch assumes that the new version of the external dependency still allows you to put objects of type `ManagedObject` into the registry, even if the value type of the SortedMap has changed to `ManagedObject<?>`. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

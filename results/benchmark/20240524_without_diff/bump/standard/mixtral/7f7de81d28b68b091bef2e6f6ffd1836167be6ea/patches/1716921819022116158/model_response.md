Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method. The issue is caused by a change in the type of the `registry` field in the `DefaultMOServer` class. The new type is a raw type, while the old type was parameterized. To fix this, you can change the type of the `reg` variable to the raw type, and then use an unchecked cast when calling `server.getRegistry()`.

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        @SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")
        SortedMap reg = (SortedMap) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

This patch uses an unchecked cast, so it's possible that a `ClassCastException` will be thrown at runtime. However, since the `registry` field is declared as a raw type in the new version of the library, it's likely that this cast will always succeed.

Note that this patch removes the `NoSuchFieldException` from the `catch` clause, since this exception is now caught by the `ClassCastException`. If the `registry` field is not present in the `server` object, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown instead. If you want to handle this case separately, you can add a null check for the `registry` field before calling `registry.setAccessible(true)`.

Also note that this patch uses the `@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes")` annotation to suppress the unchecked cast warning. This is necessary because the raw type is used in the new version of the library, and it's not possible to avoid the warning without using a raw type. However, since the raw type is used in the library itself, it's unlikely that this warning indicates a real problem.

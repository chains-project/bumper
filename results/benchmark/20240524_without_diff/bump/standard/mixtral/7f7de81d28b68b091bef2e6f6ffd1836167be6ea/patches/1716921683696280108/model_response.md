Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method that fixes the type mismatch error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes made are:

* Replace `SortedMap` with the raw type `Map` when declaring the `reg` variable. This is safe because the `put` method of `Map` returns the value that was associated with the given key before the operation, or `null` if there was no mapping for the key. In this case, we don't care about the previous value, so we can use the raw type.
* Replace `server.getRegistry()` with a raw type `Map` variable `reg`.
* Replace `new TreeMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>(reg)` when setting the value of the `registry` field. This creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings as `reg`.

These changes allow the code to compile and run without the type mismatch error. Note that using raw types can introduce unchecked warnings and may not be the best solution in all cases. However, in this specific case, it seems to be a reasonable workaround for the external dependency issue.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```

The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at the end of the import statement. In this case, it seems that the missing semicolon is causing the compilation error. Therefore, I have added the semicolon to the end of the import statement.

Note that I have also imported all the classes from the io.github.p2p package using the wildcard character '*'. This is because I do not know which specific class from the package is being used in the client code. If only a specific class from the package is being used, then it would be better to import only that class to avoid potential naming conflicts.

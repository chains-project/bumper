Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `FastMath` class of the `org.apache.commons.math3.util` package. This package provides a wide range of mathematical functions, including the sigmoid function.

Note that this patch assumes that the `org.apache.commons.math3` library is already added as a dependency in the project. If it's not, you can add it using the appropriate package manager for your build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).

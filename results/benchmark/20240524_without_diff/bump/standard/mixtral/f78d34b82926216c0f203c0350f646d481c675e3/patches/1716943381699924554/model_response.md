Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at column 21 of line 4. Looking at the client code, it appears that there is a missing import statement for the `p2p` class. Therefore, I added a wildcard import statement to import all classes in the `io.github.p2p` package. This should resolve the compilation error.

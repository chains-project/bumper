Here's the patched code that replaces the failing line:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.ml.distance.EuclideanDistance;
```
This code imports the `EuclideanDistance` class from the `org.apache.commons.math3.ml.distance` package, which can be used as a replacement for the missing `LearnMath` class from the `develop.p2p.lib` package.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and the actual solution may vary depending on the specific functionality required by the client code. In general, it's a good practice to use well-established and actively maintained libraries for external dependencies to minimize the risk of encountering issues like this.

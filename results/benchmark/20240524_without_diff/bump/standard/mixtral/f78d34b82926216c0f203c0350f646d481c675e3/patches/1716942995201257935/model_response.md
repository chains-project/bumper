Here's a proposed patch for the given client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.sigmoid;
```

In this patch, we replace the non-existent package `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` with `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath`, which provides the `sigmoid` function.

Note: You may need to add the required dependency to your project's build configuration. In this case, you can add the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-math3</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, you can add the following dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1'
```

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```

In this patch, I added a wildcard `*` after `p2p` to import all the classes and interfaces from the `io.github.p2p` package. This will fix the error message `'';' expected` because the compiler is expecting a semicolon after a type name, but it is missing the import statement for the classes and interfaces used in the code.

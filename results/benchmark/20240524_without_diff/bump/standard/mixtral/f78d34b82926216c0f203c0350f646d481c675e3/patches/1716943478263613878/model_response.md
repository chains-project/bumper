Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The original code only imports the `p2p` package from the `io.github` namespace, but it seems that the `p2p` package contains a class or interface that the client code is trying to use. To fix the error, we need to import all the public types from the `p2p` package. This can be done by appending an asterisk (`*`) after the package name.

Note: This patch assumes that the `p2p` package contains at least one public type that the client code is trying to use. If this assumption is incorrect, then a different patch may be necessary.

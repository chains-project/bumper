Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that a semicolon is expected at the end of the import statement. However, since the import statement is correct, it seems that the real issue is that the compiler does not recognize the `p2p` package.
To fix this, I added a wildcard `*` to the import statement, so that all classes inside the `p2p` package are imported. This should solve the issue if the missing class is part of the `p2p` package.
If the missing class is not part of the `p2p` package, then the error might be caused by a different issue, and this patch might not work. In that case, additional information would be needed to diagnose and fix the issue.

Here's a proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` method from the `FastMath` class of the `org.apache.commons.math3.util` package. This package is a widely used mathematics library that provides various mathematical functions, including the sigmoid function.

Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement by importing the `sigmoid` method from the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision` class, which can be used as a substitute for the missing `sigmoid` method from the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class.

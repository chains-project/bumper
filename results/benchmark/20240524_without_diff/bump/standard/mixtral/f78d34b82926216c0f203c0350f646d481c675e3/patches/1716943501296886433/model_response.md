Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at the end of the import statement. This usually means that the import statement is not correctly formatted. In this case, the import statement is missing the semicolon at the end. Therefore, adding a semicolon to the end of the import statement should fix the error.
However, the error message specifically mentions that the semicolon is expected at position 21, which is after the `p2p` identifier. This suggests that the import statement might be trying to import a static member of the `p2p` class, but the syntax is incorrect.
To fix this, I added a `*` after `p2p` to import all static members of the `p2p` class. This should allow the client code to access the static members of the `p2p` class without causing a syntax error.
Note that this patch assumes that the `p2p` class and its static members exist and are accessible from the client code. If this is not the case, then the client code may still fail to compile or run due to other errors.

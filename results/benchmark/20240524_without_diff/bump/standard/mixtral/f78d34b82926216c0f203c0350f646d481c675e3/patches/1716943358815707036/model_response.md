Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that a semicolon is expected at column 21 of line 4 in the file `Decorations.java`. This suggests that the compiler is expecting a statement, but it encounters a token that is not a statement.

Looking at the provided code, there is only one line of code, which is an import statement. The import statement is not a statement, but a directive to the compiler to include a class or package.

The import statement in the provided code only imports the package `io.github.p2p`, but not any specific class or interface. This means that any class or interface in the package `io.github.p2p` can be used in the code, but it needs to be fully qualified.

Therefore, to fix the error, we need to import a specific class or interface from the package `io.github.p2p` that is used in the code. Since the error message does not provide any information about which class or interface is used, I assume that there is a missing class or interface that is used in the code.

To be safe, I add a wildcard `*` to the import statement, which imports all classes and interfaces in the package `io.github.p2p`. This ensures that any class or interface in the package can be used in the code without being fully qualified.

However, this patch may introduce other errors if there are multiple classes or interfaces with the same name in the package `io.github.p2p`. In this case, the code needs to be modified to use fully qualified names or to import specific classes or interfaces.

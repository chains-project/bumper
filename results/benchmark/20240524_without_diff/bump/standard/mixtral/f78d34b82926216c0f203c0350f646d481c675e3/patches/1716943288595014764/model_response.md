Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at the end of the import statement. However, the code does not contain any syntax errors. Therefore, it is possible that the issue is caused by a missing class or package in the `io.github.p2p` package.

To fix the error, I added a wildcard character `*` to the import statement. This will import all classes and packages in the `io.github.p2p` package. This will ensure that any missing classes or packages are imported correctly.

Note: This patch assumes that the `io.github.p2p` package exists and is accessible from the client code. If this is not the case, the error may be caused by a different issue.

Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at the end of the import statement. However, since the import statement is correct, it seems that the problem is caused by a missing class or interface in the imported package. To solve this, I added a wildcard `*` to the import statement, which imports all classes and interfaces from the package.
Note: This patch assumes that the missing class or interface is not used in the client code. If it is used, the client code needs to be modified accordingly.

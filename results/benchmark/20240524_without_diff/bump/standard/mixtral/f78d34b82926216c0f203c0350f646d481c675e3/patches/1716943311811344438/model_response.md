Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import io.github.p2p.*;
```
In this patch, I added a wildcard import statement for the `io.github.p2p` package. This will import all the public classes, interfaces, and enum types from the package, which should resolve the error caused by the missing import statement.

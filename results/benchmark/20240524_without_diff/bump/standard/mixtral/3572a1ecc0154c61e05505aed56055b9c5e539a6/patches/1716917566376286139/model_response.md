Here is a possible patch for the given code:
```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer initialValue() {
    java.io.InputStream inputStream = null;
    try {
        inputStream = new java.net.Socket("localhost", 9090).getInputStream();
        return new org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer(new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TCompactProtocol.Factory(), new org.apache.thrift.transport.TInputStreamTransport(inputStream));
    } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
        throw new java.lang.RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The original code uses the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, which seems to be not available or not found in the classpath. The patch uses the `TInputStreamTransport` class instead, which is a simple wrapper around an `InputStream` and should work with any thrift service that accepts a raw input stream. The `TSocket` class is replaced with the standard `Socket` class from the `java.net` package, and the `TFramedTransport` constructor is replaced with the `TInputStreamTransport` constructor that takes an `InputStream`. The `TTransportException` is replaced with the more general `IOException`.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os));
    framedTransport.setFramedTransportBufferSize(bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch replaces the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. The `TFastFramedTransport` class is not part of the Thrift library, and it seems that it was mistakenly used in the original code.

Additionally, the `setFramedTransportBufferSize` method is used to set the buffer capacity for the `TFramedTransport` instance. This method is part of the `TFramedTransport` class and can be used to achieve the same functionality as the original code.

Note that the `TFastFramedTransport` class may have additional features or optimizations that are not present in the `TFramedTransport` class. However, without more information about the specific requirements of the code, it is not possible to determine if these features are necessary for the code to function correctly.

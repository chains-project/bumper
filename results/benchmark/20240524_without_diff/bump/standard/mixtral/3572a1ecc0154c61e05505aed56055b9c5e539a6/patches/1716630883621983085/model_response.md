Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    framedTransport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport(os));
    framedTransport.setFramedTransportBufferSize(bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `TFastFramedTransport` class cannot be found. This class is part of the `com.pinterest.singer` package and may have been removed or renamed in the version of the library that you are using.

To fix this error, we can use the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package instead. This class provides similar functionality to `TFastFramedTransport`, but it is part of the core Thrift library and is less likely to be removed or renamed.

We can create a `TFramedTransport` object and set its buffer size using the `setFramedTransportBufferSize` method. Then, we can use the `TBinaryProtocol` class with the `TFramedTransport` object to serialize and write data to the output stream.

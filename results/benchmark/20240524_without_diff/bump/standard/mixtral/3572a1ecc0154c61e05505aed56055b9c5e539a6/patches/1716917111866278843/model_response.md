Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    int bufferCapacity = 10;
    Transport transport = new TFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os));
    transport.open();
    framedTransport = (FramedTransport) transport;
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch replaces the use of the `TFastFramedTransport` class with a `FramedTransport` object created using a `TFramedTransport.Factory`. This should resolve the error caused by the missing `TFastFramedTransport` class. Note that the `TIOStreamTransport` is wrapped in a `TFramedTransport.Factory` to create a `FramedTransport` object. The `FramedTransport` object is then cast to a `FramedTransport` to allow for the use of the `open()` method. Additionally, the `bufferCapacity` variable has been declared as an `int` rather than a `final int` to simplify the code.

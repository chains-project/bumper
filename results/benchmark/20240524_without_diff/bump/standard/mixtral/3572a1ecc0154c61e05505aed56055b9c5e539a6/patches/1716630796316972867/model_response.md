Here's the proposed patch for the given client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer initialValue() {
    try {
        return new org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer(new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol.Factory());
    } catch (org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```

This patch adds a try-catch block to handle the `TTransportException` that needs to be caught or declared in the method signature. Since it's not possible to change the method signature, the caught exception is re-thrown as a `RuntimeException`.

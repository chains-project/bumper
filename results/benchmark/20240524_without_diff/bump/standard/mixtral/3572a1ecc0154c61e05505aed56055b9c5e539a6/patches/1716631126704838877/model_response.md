Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch removes the import for the `TFastFramedTransport` class, which is causing the compilation error. Instead, it uses the `TFramedTransport` class, which is a part of the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. This class provides similar functionality to `TFastFramedTransport`, so it should be a suitable replacement. Additionally, the `bufferCapacity` variable has been moved to a local variable within the `init` method, as it is not used outside of this method.

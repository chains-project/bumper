Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

The patch replaces the deprecated `TFastFramedTransport` with the `TFramedTransport` class. The `TFramedTransport` class is added in the same package as `TFastFramedTransport`, so it should be compatible with the rest of the code. This should fix the error message related to the missing `TFastFramedTransport` symbol.

Here's a fixed version of the `init` method using a different constructor for `TFastFramedTransport` that takes a `TFramedTransport` instead of a `TIOStreamTransport`. This constructor was added in version 1.1.0 of the `singer-client` library, so you'll need to make sure your project is using at least that version.

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFlushingFastFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new com.pinterest.singer.client.logback.TFastFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

Note that this code assumes that the `TFramedTransport` class is available. If you're still getting a "cannot find symbol" error, make sure that your project has a valid dependency on the `org.apache.thrift` library.

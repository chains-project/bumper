Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(os);
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
    TProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch removes the direct dependency on the `TFastFramedTransport` class from the `com.pinterest.singer.client.logback` package, and instead uses the `TFramedTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, which should be available as an external dependency. The patch also creates a new `TTransport` instance using `TIOStreamTransport`, and then wraps it with `TFramedTransport` to create a framed transport. Finally, a new `TBinaryProtocol` instance is created using the framed transport. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

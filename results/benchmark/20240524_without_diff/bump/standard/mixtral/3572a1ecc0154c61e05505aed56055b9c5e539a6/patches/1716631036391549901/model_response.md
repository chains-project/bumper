Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer initialValue() {
    org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport transport = null;
    try {
        transport = new org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport(new org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket("localhost", 9090));
        transport.open();
        return new org.apache.thrift.TDeserializer(new org.apache.thrift.protocol.TCompactProtocol(transport));
    } catch (org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    } finally {
        if (transport != null) {
            transport.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This patch creates a `TFramedTransport` instance with a `TSocket` to connect to a local Thrift server at port 9090. It catches the `TTransportException` and re-throws it as a `RuntimeException`. It also ensures that the transport is closed in the `finally` block.

Note that the patch assumes that there is a Thrift server running at the given address and port. If that's not the case, the code will fail with a `TTransportException`.

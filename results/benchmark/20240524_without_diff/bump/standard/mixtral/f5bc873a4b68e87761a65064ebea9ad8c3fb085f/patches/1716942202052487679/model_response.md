Here's a fixed version of the method that imports the missing `MavenProject` class:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```

This code imports the missing `MavenProject` class at the beginning of the file, which should solve the compilation error.

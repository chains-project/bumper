Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.FileUtils;

// ...

File targetDir = new File(outputDirectory, "theme");
FileUtils.deleteDirectory(targetDir);
```
Explanation:

The original code is missing the necessary import statement for `org.codehaus.plexus.util.FileUtils`, which is required to call the `deleteDirectory` method. The proposed patch includes the necessary import statement and uses `FileUtils.deleteDirectory` to delete the target directory instead of using `File.deleteRecursively`, which may not be available in the client code.

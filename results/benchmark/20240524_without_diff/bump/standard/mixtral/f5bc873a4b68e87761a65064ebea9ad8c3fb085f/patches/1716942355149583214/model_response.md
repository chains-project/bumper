Here's a fixed version of the failing method that imports the missing `MavenProject` class:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
This code imports the missing `MavenProject` class at the beginning of the file and then returns the `project` variable as before. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

To fix the error, you need to import the `MavenProject` class from the correct package. Here is the fixed code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
Note that I added the import statement at the beginning of the file. This will ensure that the `MavenProject` class is properly resolved. Also, I did not change the function signature or create any new variables.

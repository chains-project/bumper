Here's a possible patch for the code you provided:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```
The patch imports the missing `MavenProject` class and adds the necessary import statement at the beginning of the file. This assumes that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized properly in the enclosing class. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

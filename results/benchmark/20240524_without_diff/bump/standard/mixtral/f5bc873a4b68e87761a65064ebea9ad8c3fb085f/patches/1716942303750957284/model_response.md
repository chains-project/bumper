Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

public MavenProject getProject() {
    return project;
}
```

This patch imports the missing `MavenProject` class at the beginning of the file, so that it is visible in the method signature. It's possible that the missing import statement was accidentally deleted or never added in the first place.

Note that this patch assumes that the `project` variable is already defined and initialized correctly in the enclosing class. If that's not the case, then additional changes may be necessary.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.FileUtils;

// ...

File targetDir = new File(outputDirectory, "theme");
FileUtils.forceMkdir(targetDir);
```
Explanation:
The original code only imports the `File` class from the `java.io` package, but it seems like the code is trying to use the `forceMkdir` method, which is not a method of the `File` class. Instead, it is a method of the `FileUtils` class from the `org.codehaus.plexus.util` package. Therefore, we need to import the `FileUtils` class and use it to create the target directory.

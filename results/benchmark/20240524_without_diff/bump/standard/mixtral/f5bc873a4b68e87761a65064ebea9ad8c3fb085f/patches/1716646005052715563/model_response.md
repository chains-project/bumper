Here's the updated code that should fix the error:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// ...

try (InputStream input = new FileInputStream(new File(filePath))) {
    Files.copy(input, Paths.get(destination));
}
```
Explanation:
The original code uses `FileInputStream` which requires a `File` object as an argument. However, the `File` class does not have a `getAbsolutePath()` method. I replaced the `getAbsolutePath()` method with `new File(filePath)` to fix the issue. Additionally, I wrapped the `FileInputStream` in a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the stream is closed properly.

Note:
The code above does not include the import statement for `java.nio.file.Paths` and `java.io.FileInputStream`, but they should be added to the imports if they are not already there.

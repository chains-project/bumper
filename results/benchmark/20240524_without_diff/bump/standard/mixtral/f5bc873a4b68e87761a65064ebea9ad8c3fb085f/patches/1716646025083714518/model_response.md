Here's the modified code that replaces the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// ...

try {
    File inputFile = new File("input.txt");
    byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(inputFile.getPath()));
    // Use the 'bytes' variable for further processing
    // ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exceptions
    // ...
}
```
This code snippet uses the Java NIO `Files` class to read the contents of a file instead of the failing `File.list()` method.

However, the given error message suggests that the issue might be related to the location of the class or missing imports. In that case, you might need to check the project setup and the classpath.

Nonetheless, the provided code snippet should work as a replacement for the failing code.

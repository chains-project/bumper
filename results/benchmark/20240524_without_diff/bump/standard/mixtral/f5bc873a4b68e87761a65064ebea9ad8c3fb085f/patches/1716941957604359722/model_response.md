Here's a possible patch for the client code to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Create a new MavenProject instance using a Model instance
MavenProject mavenProject = new MavenProject(new Model());
```
Note that this patch creates a new `MavenProject` instance using a `Model` instance instead of using the deprecated constructor that takes a `Session session` argument. This should fix the error caused by the missing `org.apache.maven.project` package.

However, it's important to note that this patch may not work in all cases, as it assumes that the missing package is only used by the deprecated constructor. If the missing package is used elsewhere in the code, additional changes may be necessary to fix the error.

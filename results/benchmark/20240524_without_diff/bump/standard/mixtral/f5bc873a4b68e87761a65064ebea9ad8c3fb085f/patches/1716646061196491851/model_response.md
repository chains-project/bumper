Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import java.io.File;
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.FileUtils;

// ...

File targetDir = new File(outputDirectory, "theme");
FileUtils.deleteDirectory(targetDir);
```
In this patch, I added the `FileUtils` class from the `plexus-utils` library to delete the target directory.
I assumed that the original intention was to delete the directory before creating it.
If that's not the case, please provide more context about the error message and the surrounding code.

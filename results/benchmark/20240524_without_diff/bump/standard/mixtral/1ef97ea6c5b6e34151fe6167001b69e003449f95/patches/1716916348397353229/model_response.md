Here's the fixed version of the `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The code you provided is already correct, and the error message you provided is unrelated to this method. The error is likely caused by the usage of this method elsewhere in the code.

The error message "incompatible types: java.util.Date cannot be converted to java.sql.Timestamp" indicates that there is a place in the code where a `java.sql.Timestamp` is expected, but a `java.util.Date` is provided instead.

To fix this error, you need to find the place in the code where this is happening and convert the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object using the `new Timestamp(long time)` constructor.

For example, if you have a method that takes a `Timestamp` parameter but you're passing a `Date` object instead, you can fix it like this:

```java
public void someMethod(Timestamp timestamp) {
    // ...
}

// Calling the method with a Date object
someMethod(new Timestamp(date.getTime()));
```

Make sure to check the code where this method is being called and convert the `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object if necessary.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

In this patch, I have fully qualified the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes to make it clear that we are using `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`. This should fix the incompatible types error.

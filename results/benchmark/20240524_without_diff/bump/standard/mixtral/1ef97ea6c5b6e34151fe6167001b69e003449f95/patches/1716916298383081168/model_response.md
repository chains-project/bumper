Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDateTime();
}
```

The error occurs because you are trying to return a `java.sql.Timestamp` object from a method that returns a `java.util.Date`. To resolve this, you can convert the `java.util.Date` object returned by `super.between` to a `Timestamp` and then convert it to a `LocalDateTime` using `toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toLocalDateTime()`. This way, you can return a `LocalDateTime` object that is compatible with the method's return type.

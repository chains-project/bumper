Here' tool-generated patch for the `between` method in the `DateTime` class:

```java
public class DateTime extends DateAndTime {
    protected DateTime(Faker faker) {
        super(faker);
    }

    @Override
    public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
        return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toLocalDateTime().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant().toEpochMilli();
    }
}
```
This patch converts the `Date` objects to `LocalDateTime` and then to `Instant`, which is compatible with the `Timestamp` constructor.

Note that the `Timestamp` constructor that accepts an `long` argument is deprecated in Java 11. Instead, you can use the `Timestamp(Instant instant)` constructor, which is available since Java 8. If you need to support Java versions prior to 8, you should consider using a different approach.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change I made is to specify the fully-qualified name for the `Timestamp` class. This ensures that the correct `Timestamp` class is used, rather than the `Date` class, which was causing the incompatible types error.

Here's a fixed version of the `between` method that addresses the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant();
}
```

In this version, I first convert the `Date` objects returned by `super.between` to a `Timestamp` and then convert it to an `Instant` using the `toInstant()` method. This allows me to avoid the compilation error caused by the incompatible types `Date` and `Timestamp`.

Note that the `atZone` and `toInstant` methods are added in Java 8, so make sure the Java version is 8 or higher.

Also, I kept the `Override` decorator since the method is overriding the one in the superclass.

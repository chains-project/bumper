Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change made is to explicitly specify the fully-qualified names for the `Date` and `Timestamp` classes, as the error message suggests that there is a conflict between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`. By using the fully-qualified names, we ensure that the correct classes are being used.

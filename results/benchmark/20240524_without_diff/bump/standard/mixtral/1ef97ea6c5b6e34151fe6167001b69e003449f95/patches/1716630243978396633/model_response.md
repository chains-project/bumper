Here'1 possible patch for the failing `between` method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timdate(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This patch uses the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor instead of the `Timestamp(Date date)` constructor, which is causing the incompatible types error.

Note that I had to make up the `Timdate` class since it's not part of the JDK. You'll need to replace it with the actual class that you want to use to wrap the `long` value returned by `super.between(from, to).getTime()`.

If no such class is available, you can use `new java.sql.Timestamp(long time)` instead:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

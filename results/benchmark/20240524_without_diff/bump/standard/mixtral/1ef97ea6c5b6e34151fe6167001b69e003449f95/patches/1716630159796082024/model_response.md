Here is a fixed version of the `between` method that resolves the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime()).toInstant().truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS).toEpochMilli();
}
```

In this version, I convert the `Date` returned by `super.between` to a `Timestamp`, and then convert that to an `Instant` using the `toInstant()` method. I then truncate the `Instant` to the nearest millisecond using `truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MILLIS)`, and finally convert it back to a `long` representing the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch using `toEpochMilli()`. This ensures that the method returns a `Timestamp` object with the same value as the original `Date` objects.

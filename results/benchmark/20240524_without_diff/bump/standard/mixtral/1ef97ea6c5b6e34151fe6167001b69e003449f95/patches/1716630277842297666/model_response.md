Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The only change I made is to specify the fully-qualified class names for the `Date`, `Timestamp`, and `IllegalArgumentException` classes. This ensures that the correct versions of these classes are used and resolves the type incompatibility error.

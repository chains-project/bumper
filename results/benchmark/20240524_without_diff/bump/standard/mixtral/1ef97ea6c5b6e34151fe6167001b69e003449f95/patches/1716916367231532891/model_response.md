Here's the fixed `between` method:

```java
@Override
public java.sql.Timestamp between(java.util.Date from, java.util.Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new java.sql.Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

The issue was caused by the usage of the wrong `Date` and `Timestamp` classes. I replaced `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp` with their fully qualified names. This ensures that the correct classes are used, resolving the incompatible types error.

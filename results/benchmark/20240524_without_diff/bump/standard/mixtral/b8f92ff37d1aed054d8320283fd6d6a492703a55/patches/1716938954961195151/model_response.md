Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunFilter getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunFilter.Wildcard();
}
```
In this patch, we changed the package name of the `TestListResolver` to `TestsToRunFilter` and updated the corresponding import statement. This is because the `Wildcard` class has been moved to a different package in a newer version of the `maven-surefire` library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `maven-surefire` library version has been updated and the `Wildcard` class is now located in the `org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunFilter` package. If this is not the case, the patch may not work and a different solution may be required.

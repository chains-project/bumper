Here's a potential patch for the code:
```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, "**/*.class");
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `getWildcard()` method cannot be found in the `TestListResolver` class. This method might have been removed or renamed in a newer version of the Apache Maven Surefire plugin.

To fix the issue, we can replace the call to `getWildcard()` with a hard-coded wildcard string `"**/*.class"` that matches all class files. This way, we can avoid relying on the `TestListResolver` class altogether.

Note that this patch assumes that the `DirectoryScanner` class still accepts a wildcard pattern as a string argument. If this is not the case, further modifications might be necessary.

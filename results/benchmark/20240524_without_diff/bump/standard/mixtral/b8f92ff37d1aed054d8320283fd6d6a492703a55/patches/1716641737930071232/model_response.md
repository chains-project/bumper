Here's the proposed patch:

```java
static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver().getWildcard());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `getWildcard()` cannot be found in `TestListResolver`. This is likely because the `getWildcard()` method is not a static method and needs to be called on an instance of `TestListResolver`.

To fix the error, I created a new instance of `TestListResolver` and called the `getWildcard()` method on it. This should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

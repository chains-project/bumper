Here's the proposed patch:

```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver. WildcardImpl();
}
```

I created a new variable `WildcardImpl` which is a fully qualified name of the class that implements the `Wildcard` interface. This should fix the error message.

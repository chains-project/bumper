Here's a proposed patch for the given failing client code:
```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver. WildcardImpl();
}
```
Note that I've changed the constructor call to use `WildcardImpl` instead of `Wildcard`. This is because `Wildcard` is an interface, and interfaces cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, we need to use a concrete implementation of the interface, such as `WildcardImpl`.

Also, I've added a space between `TestListResolver.` and `WildcardImpl()` to follow Java naming conventions.

This patch assumes that `WildcardImpl` is a class that implements `org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard` and is available in the classpath. If that's not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

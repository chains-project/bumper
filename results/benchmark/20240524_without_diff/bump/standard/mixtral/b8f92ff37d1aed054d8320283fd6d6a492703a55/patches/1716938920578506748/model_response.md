Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardImpl();
}
```

In this version, we are using the fully qualified name of the `WildcardImpl` class, which is a concrete implementation of the `Wildcard` interface. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that the `WildcardImpl` class was added in version 2.22.0 of the `maven-surefire-api` library, so this solution assumes that you are using at least that version. If you are using an earlier version, you may need to upgrade the library or find a different solution.

Here's the fixed method with the updated import statement:
```java
import org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver;

private static TestListResolver.Wildcard getWildcard() {
    return new TestListResolver.Wildcard();
}
```
The issue was caused by the missing import statement for `TestListResolver`. I've added the import statement and updated the code to use the fully qualified name `TestListResolver.Wildcard`.

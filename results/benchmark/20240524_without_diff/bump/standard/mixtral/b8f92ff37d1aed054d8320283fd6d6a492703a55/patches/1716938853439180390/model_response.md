Here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunImpl.Wildcard getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunImpl.Wildcard();
}
```
In this patch, we have changed the package name of the `Wildcard` class from `org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver` to `org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunImpl`. This is because the `Wildcard` class has been moved to the `org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRunImpl` package in newer versions of the Surefire library.

Note that this patch assumes that the Surefire library version used in the project has been updated, but the client code has not been updated accordingly. This patch changes the client code to use the `Wildcard` class from the correct package in the updated Surefire library.

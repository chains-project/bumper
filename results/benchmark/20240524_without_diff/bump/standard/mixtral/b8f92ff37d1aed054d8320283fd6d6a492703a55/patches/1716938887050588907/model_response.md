Here is a potential patch for the code:

```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRun getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.util.TestsToRun.Wildcard();
}
```

In this patch, I changed the import statement from `org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset` to `org.apache.maven.surefire.util`, and changed the class name from `TestListResolver.Wildcard` to `TestsToRun.Wildcard`. This is because the `TestListResolver.Wildcard` class is deprecated in the newer version of the Surefire library, and it is recommended to use `TestsToRun.Wildcard` instead.

Note that this patch assumes that the Surefire library has been updated to a version that includes the `TestsToRun` class. If the library has not been updated, then this patch may not work. In that case, it may be necessary to either update the library or find a different solution to the problem.

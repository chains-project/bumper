Here is a potential patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestFileSet;

static java.util.List<java.lang.String> getClassesLoc(java.io.File testSrcFolder) {
    org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.util.DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, new TestFileSet().getIncludes());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```
In this patch, we have replaced the call to `TestListResolver.getWildcard()` with `new TestFileSet().getIncludes()`. This is because the `getWildcard()` method has been removed and replaced with `getIncludes()` in newer versions of the Surefire API.

By creating a new instance of `TestFileSet` and calling `getIncludes()` on it, we can obtain a similar result to what was previously obtained using `getWildcard()`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TestFileSet` class and its `getIncludes()` method are available in the project's dependencies. If this is not the case, then a different approach may be necessary.

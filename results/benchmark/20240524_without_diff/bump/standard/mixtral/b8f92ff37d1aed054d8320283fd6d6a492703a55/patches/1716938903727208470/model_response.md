Here is a fixed version of your method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard getWildcard() {
    return new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardImpl();
}
```

I changed the constructor call from `new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.Wildcard()` to `new org.apache.maven.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver.WildcardImpl()`. It seems that the `Wildcard` class is not directly instantiable, and that `WildcardImpl` should be used instead. This is a common pattern in Java, where an interface (`Wildcard` in this case) is used as a public API, while an implementation class (`WildcardImpl`) is used for actual instantiation.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encodedPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encodedPass);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we replace the `PasswordEncoder` from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with `BasicPasswordEncryptor` from `org.jasypt.util.password`. The `PasswordEncoder` class is no longer available in newer versions of Jasypt, so we use `BasicPasswordEncryptor` as an alternative. The `encode` and `matches` methods are implemented using the corresponding methods from `BasicPasswordEncryptor`.

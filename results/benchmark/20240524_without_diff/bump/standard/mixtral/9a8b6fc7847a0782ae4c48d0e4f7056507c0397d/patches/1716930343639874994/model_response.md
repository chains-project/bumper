Here is a patched version of the failing method that replaces the missing dependency with a different, but functionally equivalent, library:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    private Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncoder.encode(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encodedPass) {
        return passwordEncoder.matches(rawPass, encodedPass);
    }
}
```

In this patched version, I have replaced the missing `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class with the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` class, which provides similar functionality. I have also updated the import statement and the variable declaration accordingly.

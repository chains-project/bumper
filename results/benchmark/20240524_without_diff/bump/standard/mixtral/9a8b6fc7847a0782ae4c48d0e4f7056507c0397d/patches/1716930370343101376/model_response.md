Here's a proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

// Replace the failing line with the following code
BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
textEncryptor.setPassword("your-password-here");
String encryptedPassword = textEncryptor.encrypt("plain-text-password-here");
```
In this patch, we're using the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package instead of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class, allowing us to encrypt and decrypt text.

Note that you'll need to replace the placeholders `"your-password-here"` and `"plain-text-password-here"` with appropriate values. Also, keep in mind that this patch is just a workaround for the missing dependency, and it may not provide the same level of security or functionality as the original code.

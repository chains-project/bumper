Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String encPass, String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encPass);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The original code uses the `PasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package, which is no longer available. To fix the error, I replaced the `PasswordEncoder` with `BasicPasswordEncryptor` from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package. This class provides similar functionality for encrypting and checking passwords.

Note:
This patch assumes that the original code only uses the `encode` and `matches` methods from the `PasswordEncoder` interface. If the original code uses other methods from the `PasswordEncoder` interface, additional changes may be necessary.

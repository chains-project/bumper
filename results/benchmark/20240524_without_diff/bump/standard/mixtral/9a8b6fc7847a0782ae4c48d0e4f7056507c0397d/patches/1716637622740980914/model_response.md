Here's a patched version of the code that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` from Jasypt. This way, we avoid the external dependency issue.

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    return new org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```

This should resolve the compilation error you were facing.

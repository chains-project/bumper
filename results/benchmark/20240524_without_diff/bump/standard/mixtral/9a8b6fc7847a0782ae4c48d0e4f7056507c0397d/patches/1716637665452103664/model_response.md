Here's the proposed patch:
```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that I have imported the necessary classes for you:
```java
import org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder;
import org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor;
```
This patch removes the fully qualified names of the classes, assuming that they have been imported correctly. If not, you may need to add the necessary import statements.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {
    private StrongPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new StrongPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPassword) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPassword);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword, encodedPassword);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we replace the `PasswordEncoder` interface from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package. This class provides similar functionality for encoding and checking passwords.

Note that this patch assumes that the original code was using the `PasswordEncoder` interface from the `jasypt-spring-boot` library, which has been removed in newer versions. The `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class is part of the `jasypt` library, which is a more general-purpose library for encryption and decryption.

Also note that the `matches` method in the original code has been changed to use `checkPassword` method of `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully. However, it's always a good idea to thoroughly test the code after applying any patch to ensure that it behaves as expected.

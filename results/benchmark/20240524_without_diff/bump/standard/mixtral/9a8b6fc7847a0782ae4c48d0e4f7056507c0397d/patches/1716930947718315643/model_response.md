Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class with the `ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor` class, which is a subclass of `StrongPasswordEncryptor` and is still present in the jasypt library. This change should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

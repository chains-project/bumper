Here's a potential patch for the code you provided. It replaces the usage of the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class with the `BCryptPasswordEncryptor` class, which is an alternative password encryptor provided by the jasypt library.
```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.password.BCryptPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that this patch assumes that the jasypt library has been updated to a version that includes the `BCryptPasswordEncryptor` class. If that is not the case, you may need to update the library or find a different solution.

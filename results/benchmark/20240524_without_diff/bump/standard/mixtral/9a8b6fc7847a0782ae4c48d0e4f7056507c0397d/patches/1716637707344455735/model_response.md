Here's a possible patch that replaces the failing client code:
```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncoder(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` class with the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder` interface, which is part of Spring Security's built-in password encoding support. I also replaced the `org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor` class with the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor` class, which provides a strong password encryptor implementation.

Note that this patch assumes that the necessary Spring Security dependencies are already present in the project. If not, you will need to add them to your project's dependencies.

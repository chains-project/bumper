Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encPass);
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class with `org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor` from the same jasypt library.
The `encode` and `matches` methods were updated accordingly to use the new class.
Note that `BasicPasswordEncryptor` does not have the same features as `PBEPasswordEncoder`, so there might be differences in the resulting encrypted passwords.
However, this patch should fix the compilation error and allow the code to run.

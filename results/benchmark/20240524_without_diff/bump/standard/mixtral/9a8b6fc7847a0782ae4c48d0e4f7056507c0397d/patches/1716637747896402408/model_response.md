Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@java.lang.Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurableStandardStringDigester());
    return encoder;
}
```

This patch uses the `ConfigurableStandardStringDigester` class from the `jasypt-util` library instead of the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class. This is because the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class may have been removed or renamed in a newer version of the library, causing the "cannot find symbol" error. The `ConfigurableStandardStringDigester` class provides similar functionality and should be available in the `jasypt-util` library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `jasypt-util` library is available on the classpath and that the `ConfigurableStandardStringDigester` class is accessible. If these assumptions are not correct, the patch may not work as expected.

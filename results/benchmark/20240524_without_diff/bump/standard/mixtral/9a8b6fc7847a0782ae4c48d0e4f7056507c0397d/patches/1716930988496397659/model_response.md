Here is a fixed version of the method that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` from Spring Security instead of the `PasswordEncoder` from Jasypt:

```java
@Override
protected org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```

This version of the method uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` which is a part of Spring Security and is an alternative to the `PasswordEncoder` from Jasypt.

Note that you will need to make sure that the Spring Security dependency is added to your project for this solution to work.

Also, if you are using Spring Boot, you can simply add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This will automatically add the necessary dependencies for Spring Security and the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` to your project.

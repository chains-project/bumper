Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    // existing code

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        encryptor.setPassword(password);
    }

    public String encode(String plainText) {
        return encryptor.encrypt(plainText);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

In order to fix the error, I replaced the dependency on `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` with `org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor`. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to `PBEPasswordEncoder`, allowing us to encrypt and decrypt text.

I also added a `setPassword` method that sets the password used for encryption, and modified the `encode` method to use the `encrypt` method of `BasicTextEncryptor` instead of the original `encode` method.

Note: I made sure to keep the function signature unchanged, and did not use any removed library methods.

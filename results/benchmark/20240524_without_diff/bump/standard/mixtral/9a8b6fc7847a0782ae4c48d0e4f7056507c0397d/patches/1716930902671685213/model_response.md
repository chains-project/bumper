Here's a possible patch that replaces the failing client code:
```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncoder(new StrongPasswordEncryptor());
    return encoder;
}
```
Note that I've replaced the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` and `org.jasypt.util.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor` classes with their counterparts from the Spring Security framework, `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder` and `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StrongPasswordEncryptor`, respectively. This assumes that the Spring Security framework is available on the classpath and that the `PasswordEncoder` and `StrongPasswordEncryptor` classes from that framework provide compatible functionality. If that's not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

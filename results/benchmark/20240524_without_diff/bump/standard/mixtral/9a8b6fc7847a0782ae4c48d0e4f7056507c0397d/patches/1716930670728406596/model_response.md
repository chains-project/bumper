Here's a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.digest.StandardStringDigester;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {
    // ...

    private StandardStringDigester stringDigester;

    // ...

    @Override
    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        // Use the StandardStringDigester to encode the password
        return stringDigester.digest(rawPass);
    }

    // ...
}
```
This patch replaces the usage of `PasswordEncoder` from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with `StandardStringDigester` from `org.jasypt.digest`. The `PasswordEncoder` interface and its implementation in `org.jasypt.spring.security` package are no longer available since version 2.0.0 of Jasypt. Instead, the `StandardStringDigester` class from `org.jasypt.digest` can be used for password encoding.

Note: This patch assumes that the rest of the `GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder` class remains unchanged. The `encode` method is updated to use `StandardStringDigester` for encoding the password. Make sure to adjust other parts of the class accordingly.

Here's a patched version of the failing method that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` from Spring Security instead of the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` from Jasypt, as it seems that the latter is causing the error due to missing dependencies:

```java
@Override
protected org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder encoder = new org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setPasswordEncryptor(new org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder());
    return encoder;
}
```

Note that you need to add Spring Security to your project dependencies to use `BCryptPasswordEncoder`. If you prefer to stick with Jasypt, you may need to update your project dependencies to include the missing classes or use a different password encryptor.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encPass);
    }
}
```
In this patch, we replace the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicPasswordEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package. The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class is part of the Jasypt Spring Boot Starter package, which may have a different version or configuration than the core Jasypt library. By using the `BasicPasswordEncryptor` class, we can avoid the dependency update issue and still encrypt and compare passwords.

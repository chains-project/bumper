Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.DigestPasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder implements PasswordEncoder {
    private DigestPasswordEncoder delegate;

    public GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder() {
        this.delegate = new DigestPasswordEncoder("SHA-256");
    }

    @Override
    public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
        return delegate.encodePassword(rawPassword.toString(), null);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
        return delegate.matches(rawPassword.toString(), encodedPassword);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The original code depends on `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder`, which is part of the jasypt-spring-boot library. However, the error message indicates that this package does not exist, which suggests that the library is either not present in the project's dependencies or has been updated to a version that no longer includes this package.
To fix this error, we can use the `org.jasypt.util.password.DigestPasswordEncoder` class from the jasypt library instead. This class provides similar functionality to the `PasswordEncoder` interface from the jasypt-spring-boot library.
In the fixed code, we create a new `GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder` class that implements the `PasswordEncoder` interface. We then create a `DigestPasswordEncoder` object as a delegate and implement the `encode` and `matches` methods by delegating to the `DigestPasswordEncoder` object.
Note that we need to convert the `CharSequence` parameter to a `String` before calling the `encodePassword` and `matches` methods. We also pass `null` as the salt parameter to the `encodePassword` method, since the original code does not seem to use a salt.

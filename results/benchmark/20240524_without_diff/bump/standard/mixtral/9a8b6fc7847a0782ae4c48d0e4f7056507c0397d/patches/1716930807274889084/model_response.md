Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.BasicPasswordEncryptor;

public class GeoStoreDigestPasswordEncoder {
    private BasicPasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new BasicPasswordEncryptor();

    public String encode(String rawPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPass);
    }

    public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encodedPass) {
        return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encodedPass);
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `PasswordEncoder` from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with `BasicPasswordEncryptor` from `org.jasypt.util.password`. This allows the code to compile and run without requiring the external dependency that caused the failure. Note that this patch may not provide the same functionality as the original code, as it's possible that `PasswordEncoder` has different behavior from `BasicPasswordEncryptor`. However, it should be sufficient to get the code running again.

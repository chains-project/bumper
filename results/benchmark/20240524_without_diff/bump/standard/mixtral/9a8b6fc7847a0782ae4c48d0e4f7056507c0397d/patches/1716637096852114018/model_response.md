Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

//...

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

    //...

}
```
This patch replaces the `PBEPasswordEncoder` from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with the `BasicTextEncryptor` from `org.jasypt.util.text`. The `BasicTextEncryptor` can be used in a similar way as the `PBEPasswordEncoder` to encrypt and decrypt passwords.

Note that this patch may not be a drop-in replacement for the original code, as there may be differences in the way that the two classes encrypt and decrypt passwords. It is recommended to thoroughly test the patched code to ensure that it behaves as expected.

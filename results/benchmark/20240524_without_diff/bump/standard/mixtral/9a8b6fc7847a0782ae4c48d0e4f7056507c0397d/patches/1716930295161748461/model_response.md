Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

private BasicTextEncryptor encryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();

public String encode(String rawPassword) {
    encryptor.setPassword("your-secret-key");
    return encryptor.encrypt(rawPassword);
}
```
Note: You need to replace "your-secret-key" with a secure key of your choice. Also, this solution assumes that you are using the `PBEPasswordEncoder` to encrypt passwords. The above code snippet provides a simple alternative using `BasicTextEncryptor` instead. If you are using `PBEPasswordEncoder` for other purposes, you might need to modify the code accordingly.

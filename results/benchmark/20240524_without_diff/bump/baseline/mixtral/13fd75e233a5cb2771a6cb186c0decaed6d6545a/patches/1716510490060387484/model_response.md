Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    boolean pushed = false;
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        pushed = output.contains("Pushed");
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains(""));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
    MatcherAssert.assertThat("Pushed message was not found in the output", pushed);
}
```

In this patch, I have created a new boolean variable `pushed` to store the result of the `output.contains("Pushed")` call. This allows us to pass the empty string `""` to the `StringContains` constructor, which is what the updated library expects.

I have also added a new assertion at the end of the method to check the value of `pushed`. This ensures that the test still fails if the "Pushed" message is not found in the output.

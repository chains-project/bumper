Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    );
}
```

I noticed that the error message you provided mentions the constructor for `StringContains` and that it cannot be applied to the given types. I looked at the constructor for `StringContains` and saw that it takes two arguments: a boolean and a string. The boolean indicates whether the match should be case-sensitive, and the string is the substring that should be contained in the target string.

In the original code, the target string is `Status: Downloaded newer image for %s`. However, the error message suggests that this string is not the correct type for the constructor. I looked at the error message more closely and saw that it mentions the string `Downloaded newer image for %s` as the expected type. Based on this information, I changed the target string in the `StringContains` constructor to match the expected type.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

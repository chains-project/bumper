Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionOnInvalidPath() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        Assertions.assertThrows(
            IllegalArgumentException.class,
            () -> new UploadEntity.Request(
                new RequestLine(RqMethod.PUT, "/one/two").toString()
            ).name()
        ),
        new StringContains("Unexpected path") // removed 'false' argument
    );
}
```

In this patch, I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, as it is not needed and is causing a compilation error. The `StringContains` constructor expects only one argument, which is the expected substring.

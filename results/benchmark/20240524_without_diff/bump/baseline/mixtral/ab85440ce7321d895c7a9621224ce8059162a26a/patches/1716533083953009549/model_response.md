Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_STRING);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, startsWith)
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses a different constructor of the `StringStartsWith` class, which only takes a single argument. To achieve the same behavior as before, it creates a boolean variable `startsWith` that indicates whether the string `"/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"` contains the value of the `Location` header or not. This variable is then passed to the `StringStartsWith` constructor.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Matcher.ANY_STRING` constant is available in the new library version, since it was not modified in the changes you provided. If this constant is not available, you may need to replace it with a different value.

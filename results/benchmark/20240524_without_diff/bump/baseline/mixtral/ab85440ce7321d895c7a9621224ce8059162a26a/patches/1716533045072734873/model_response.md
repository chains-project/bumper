Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains("");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the fact that the `StringStartsWith` constructor requires a single `String` argument, and not a `boolean` and a `String`. To satisfy this requirement, it creates a `startsWith` variable that is always `true`, since the `contains` method of the `String` class returns `true` if the specified substring is present in this string, and `false` otherwise. This allows the `StringStartsWith` constructor to be called with the correct number and type of arguments.

Note that this patch is just one possible solution to the problem. There may be other ways to fix the code that are equally valid or even better. The important thing is to ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly with the new version of the library.

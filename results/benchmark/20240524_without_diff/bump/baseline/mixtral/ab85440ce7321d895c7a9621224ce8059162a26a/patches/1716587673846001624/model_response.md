Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    String format = "Status: Downloaded newer image for %s";
    return new CoreMatchers.<String>containsString(
            String.format(format, image)
    );
}
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `format` to store the format string, and used it in the `String.format` method. This should fix the error message, which was caused by a missing identifier in the original code.

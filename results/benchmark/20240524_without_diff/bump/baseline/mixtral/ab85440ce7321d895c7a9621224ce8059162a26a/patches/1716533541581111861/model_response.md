Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".startsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(new StringStartsWith.Matcher<String>(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"))
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, we create a separate variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value `true`, which was previously passed as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. We then pass a new `StringStartsWith` instance to the `IsHeader` constructor, which takes a `Matcher` instead of a boolean value. The `StringStartsWith` constructor is called with the `Matcher` created from the `startsWith` variable and the expected prefix.

Here's the fixed method with an added variable to make the code easier to understand:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    ScanResult scanResult = null;
    if (directoryScanner.scan() instanceof ScanResult) {
        scanResult = (ScanResult) directoryScanner.scan();
    }
    if (scanResult != null) {
        return scanResult.getClasses();
    }
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to scan for classes.");
}
```

This patch should resolve the error by explicitly casting the result of `directoryScanner.scan()` to `ScanResult` and storing it in a separate variable before checking if it's not null. This way, the code avoids the "')' expected" error caused by the chained conditional expression.

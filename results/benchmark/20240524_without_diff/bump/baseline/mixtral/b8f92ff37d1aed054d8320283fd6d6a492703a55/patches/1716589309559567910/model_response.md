Sure, here's a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    Collection<String> classes = directoryScanner.scan().getMatchingItems();
    return new ArrayList<>(classes);
}
```
The failure is likely caused by a change in the external dependency, where the `getClasses()` method is no longer available. Instead, we can use the `getMatchingItems()` method to get a collection of matching items, and then convert it to a list. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile again.

Here is a potential patch for the code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    Collection<String> classes = new ArrayList<>();
    for (File file : directoryScanner.scan().getIncludedFiles()) {
        if (file.isFile() && file.getName().endsWith(".class")) {
            classes.add(file.getAbsolutePath());
        }
    }
    return new ArrayList<>(classes);
}
```

This patch removes the dependency on the `getClasses()` method, which may have been removed from the `DirectoryScanner` class. Instead, it manually iterates over the files in the scan result and adds the absolute paths of any `.class` files to a list. This list is then returned.

Note that this patch assumes that the `DirectoryScanner` class still has a `scan()` method that returns a `FileSet` object. If this method has also been removed, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    if (directoryScanner.getIncludedFiles().length == 0) {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
    return Arrays.asList(directoryScanner.getIncludedFiles());
}
```
This patch checks if there are any included files before trying to get the classes. If there are no included files, the method returns an empty list. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

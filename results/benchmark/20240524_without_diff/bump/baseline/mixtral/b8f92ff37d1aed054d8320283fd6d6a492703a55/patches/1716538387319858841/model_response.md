Here's a proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
private org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.api.testset.TestListResolver getTestListResolver() {
    return new org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.booterclient.lazytestprovider.TestSetFactory().createTestListResolver(true);
}
```

This patch creates a `TestSetFactory` instance and uses it to create a new `TestListResolver` instance. This should work with the new library version, as the `TestSetFactory` class has not been removed and the `createTestListResolver` method has not changed.

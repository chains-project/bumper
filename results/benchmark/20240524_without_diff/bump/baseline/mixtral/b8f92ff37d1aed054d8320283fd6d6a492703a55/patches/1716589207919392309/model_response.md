Sure, here's a possible patch for the code:
```java
    static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
        DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
        Collection<String> classes = directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
        return new ArrayList<>(classes);
    }
```
The change here is that we're creating a new `ArrayList` from the `Collection` returned by `directoryScanner.scan().getClasses()`. This is because the `getClasses()` method returns a `Collection` of strings, but the method signature specifies that it should return a `List` of strings.

It's possible that the external dependency update removed the implementation of the `getClasses()` method that returns a `List`, and now it only returns a `Collection`. By creating a new `ArrayList` from the `Collection`, we can ensure that the method still returns a `List`.

Note that we cannot use the `List.of()` method to create a fixed-size list from the `Collection`, because that method was added in Java 9, and it's possible that the external dependency update removed support for Java 9 or higher. Therefore, we're using the constructor of `ArrayList` instead.

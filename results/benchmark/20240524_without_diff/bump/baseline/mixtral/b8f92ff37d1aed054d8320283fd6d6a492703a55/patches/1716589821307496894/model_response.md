Here is the fixed version of the method:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    ScanResult scanResult = directoryScanner.scan();
    if (scanResult != null) {
        return scanResult.getClasses();
    }
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to scan for classes.");
}
```

The issue was caused by the incorrect usage of the `instanceof` operator. Instead of checking if `scan()` returns a non-null value, it was checking if the result of `scan()` is an instance of `ScanResult`. This caused a syntax error because the result of `scan()` is not a type, but an object.

The fixed version checks if `scan()` returns a non-null value and assigns it to a variable of type `ScanResult`. Then, it checks if the variable is not null before returning the list of classes. If `scan()` returns null, it throws a `RuntimeException` with an appropriate error message.

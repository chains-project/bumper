Here's the fixed version of the method using the new library version:

```java
private TestListResolver getTestListResolver() {
    return new TestListResolver(new DefaultForkConfiguration());
}
```

The `TestListResolver` constructor now accepts a `DefaultForkConfiguration` parameter. This change was introduced in the new library version. Additionally, I have removed the `@Override` annotation since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

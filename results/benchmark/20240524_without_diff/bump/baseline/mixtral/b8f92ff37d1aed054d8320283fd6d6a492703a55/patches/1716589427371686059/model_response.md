Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    Collection<SpoonAPI> scannedElements = directoryScanner.scan();
    if (scannedElements instanceof Collection) {
        Collection<SpoonAPI> spoonApis = (Collection<SpoonAPI>) scannedElements;
        List<String> classes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (SpoonAPI spoonApi : spoonApis) {
            if (spoonApi instanceof CtTypeInformation) {
                CtTypeInformation ctTypeInformation = (CtTypeInformation) spoonApi;
                classes.add(ctTypeInformation.getQualifiedName());
            }
        }
        return classes;
    }
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected scan result: " + scannedElements);
}
```

This patch uses the `SpoonAPI` interface and `CtTypeInformation` class from the Spoon library to get the qualified names of the classes in the given directory. It checks if the `scannedElements` is an instance of `Collection` before casting it to `Collection<SpoonAPI>`. If `scannedElements` is not a collection, it throws a `RuntimeException`.

Note that I made some assumptions about the Spoon library since the error message doesn't provide enough context. Specifically, I assumed that `scan()` returns a `Collection` of `SpoonAPI` objects, and that each `SpoonAPI` object is an instance of `CtTypeInformation`. If these assumptions are incorrect, the patch may need to be modified.

Here's a potential patch for the given code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    ClasspathScanner directoryScanner = new ClasspathScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```

In this patch, I replaced `DirectoryScanner` with `ClasspathScanner` since the error message suggests that the `DirectoryScanner` class cannot be found. This assumes that `ClasspathScanner` is an added library method that can be used instead.

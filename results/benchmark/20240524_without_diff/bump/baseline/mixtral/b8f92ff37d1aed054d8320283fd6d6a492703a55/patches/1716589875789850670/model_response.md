Here's the proposed patch:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    ScanResult scanResult = null;
    if (directoryScanner.scan()) {
        scanResult = new ScanResult(directoryScanner);
    }
    if (scanResult != null) {
        return scanResult.getClasses();
    }
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to scan for classes.");
}
```

The patch creates a `ScanResult` object explicitly instead of using the enhanced `if` statement, which may not be supported in some Java versions. The error message suggests that the issue is related to the enhanced `if` statement.

Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
static List<String> getClassesLoc(File testSrcFolder) {
    ClasspathScanner directoryScanner = new ClasspathScanner(testSrcFolder, TestListResolver.getWildcard());
    return directoryScanner.scan().getClasses();
}
```

This patch replaces the `DirectoryScanner` class with a new class called `ClasspathScanner`, which is a hypothetical added class that can handle the scanning of classes in a classpath. This class is assumed to have the same methods as `DirectoryScanner`, such as `scan()` and `getClasses()`. The `DirectoryScanner` class may have been removed in the new version of the dependency, hence the need to use a different class.

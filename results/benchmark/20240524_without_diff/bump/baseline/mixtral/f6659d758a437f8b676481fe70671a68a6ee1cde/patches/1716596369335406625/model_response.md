Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

TrustedTagInspector trustInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
Yaml yaml = new Yaml(trustInspector);
```
This code creates a new `TrustedTagInspector` object and passes it to the `Yaml` constructor. This allows you to use the `Yaml` class while still using the `TrustedTagInspector` class.

Note that this code assumes that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still available in the new version of the library. If it has been removed, you may need to find a different way to achieve the same functionality.

Additionally, it is possible that the `Yaml` constructor has changed in the new version of the library. If this is the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Finally, it is possible that the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been deprecated or marked for removal in the new version of the library. If this is the case, you should consider finding a different way to achieve the same functionality, as using deprecated or soon-to-be-removed classes can cause problems in the future.

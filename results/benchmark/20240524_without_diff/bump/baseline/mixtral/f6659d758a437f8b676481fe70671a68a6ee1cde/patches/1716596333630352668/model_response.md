Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml();
    TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
    yaml.setTag(trustedTagInspector);
    return yaml;
}
```

This code creates a new `Yaml` object, then creates a `TrustedTagInspector` object and sets it as the tag for the `Yaml` object. This should allow you to use the `Yaml` class without relying on the `TrustedTagInspector` class directly.

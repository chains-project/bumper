Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
```

This code creates a new `Yaml` instance with a `TrustedTagInspector` instance, which should fix the error. Note that the import statement has also been changed to import the `Yaml` class instead of the `TrustedTagInspector` class.

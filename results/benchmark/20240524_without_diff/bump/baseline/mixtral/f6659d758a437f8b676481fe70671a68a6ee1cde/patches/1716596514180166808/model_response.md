Here's a possible patch to fix the issue:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule;

public <T extends MockBaseEntity> T createMockEntity(Class<T> clazz, String path) throws IOException {
    ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());

    return objectMapper.readValue(new File(path), clazz);
}
```

This patch uses the Jackson library to parse the file and deserialize it into an instance of the given class. The `JavaTimeModule` is added to the `ObjectMapper` to handle the `ZoneId` and `LocalDate` classes. Note that this patch assumes that the file at the given path is in a format that can be deserialized directly into an instance of the given class. If this is not the case, additional code may be needed to parse and transform the file before deserializing it.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected void setUp() throws Exception {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, we're creating a `Yaml` instance with a `TrustedTagInspector` instead of directly importing the inspector. This allows us to use the `TrustedTagInspector` class without directly importing it, which should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

protected Yaml createYaml() {
    return new Yaml(new TrustedTagInspector());
}
```

This patch creates a new method `createYaml()` that returns a new `Yaml` instance with a `TrustedTagInspector`. This way, the code can still use the `TrustedTagInspector` without directly importing it.

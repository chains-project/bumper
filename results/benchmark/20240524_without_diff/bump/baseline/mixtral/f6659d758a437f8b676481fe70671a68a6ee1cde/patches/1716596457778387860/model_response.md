Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule;

public <T extends MockBaseEntity> T createMockEntity(Class<T> clazz, String path) throws IOException {
    ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());

    return objectMapper.readValue(new File(path), clazz);
}
```

This patch uses the Jackson library to parse the file at the given path into an instance of the specified class. The `JavaTimeModule` is registered to handle the `ZoneId` and `LocalDate` classes.

Note: This patch assumes that the Jackson library is already present in the project and that it is being used for other parts of the code. If this is not the case, you may need to add the Jackson library to your project dependencies before using this patch.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule;

public <T extends MockBaseEntity> T createMockEntity(Class<T> clazz, String path) throws IOException {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    mapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());

    return mapper.readValue(new File(path), clazz);
}
```

This patch uses the Jackson library to parse the file instead of SnakeYAML. The `JavaTimeModule` is added to support parsing of `ZoneId` and `LocalDate`. Note that this patch assumes that the file at the given path is a valid JSON file. If the file format needs to be YAML, a different library may be needed.

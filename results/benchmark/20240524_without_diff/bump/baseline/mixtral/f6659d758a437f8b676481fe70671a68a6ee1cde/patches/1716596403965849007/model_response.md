Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

TrustedTagInspector trustInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
Yaml yaml = new Yaml(trustInspector);
```

This code creates a `TrustedTagInspector` instance and passes it to the `Yaml` constructor. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by providing an explicit implementation for the missing `TrustedTagInspector` type.

Note that this patch assumes that `TrustedTagInspector` is still part of the `snakeyaml` library, but is no longer imported automatically by the `Yaml` class. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the import statements or the constructor arguments accordingly.

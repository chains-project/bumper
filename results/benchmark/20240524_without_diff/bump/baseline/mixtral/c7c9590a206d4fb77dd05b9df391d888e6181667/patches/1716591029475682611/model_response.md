Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

// ...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    Sink sink = renderingContext.getDocument().getContent();
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `RenderingContext` class with the `Sink` class from the `org.apache.maven.doxia.sink` package. This is because the `RenderingContext` class seems to have been removed in the newer version of the library, and the `Sink` class provides similar functionality.

Note that this patch assumes that the `renderingContext` variable is still available in the scope of the `executeReport` method. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to make `renderingContext` available again.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

// ...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    Sink sink = renderingContext.getSink();
    // ...
}
```

In the updated code, we replaced the usage of `RenderingContext` with `Sink` which is an added library method in the new version identified with `++`. This should fix the error related to the missing package for `RenderingContext`.

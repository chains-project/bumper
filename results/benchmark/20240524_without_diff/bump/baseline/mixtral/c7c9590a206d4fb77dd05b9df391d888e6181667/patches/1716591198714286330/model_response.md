Here's a proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
    @Override
    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        if ( !canGenerateReport() )
        {
            getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
            return;
        }

        try
        {
            RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
            SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
            Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
            generate( sink, locale );
        }
        catch ( Exception e ) // Change here: use Exception to catch any exception
        {
            String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
            throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
        }
    }
```

In this patch, I changed the type of the exception being caught from `MavenReportException` to `Exception`. This is because the error message suggests that the `MavenReportException` class might have been removed, and using the base `Exception` class allows catching any exception.

However, you should further investigate the cause of the issue and update the code accordingly. Catching `Exception` is generally discouraged, as it makes it harder to understand the intended behavior. It is recommended to replace the `Exception` catch with a more specific exception once you have identified the root cause of the problem.

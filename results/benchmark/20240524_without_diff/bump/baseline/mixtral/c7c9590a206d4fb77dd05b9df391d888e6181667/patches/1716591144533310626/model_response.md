Here's a proposed patch for the `execute()` method:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
    throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        generate( sink, locale );
    }
    catch ( Exception e ) // use a more general exception type
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

This patch replaces the more specific `MavenReportException` with the more general `Exception`. This will allow the code to compile even if `MavenReportException` is no longer available. However, it may hide some specific issues that were previously caught by `MavenReportException`. It's recommended to check if a more specific exception can be used instead.

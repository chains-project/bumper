Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

private void renderDecorations(Sink sink, RenderingContext renderingContext) {
    // You might need to update the import statement for RenderingContext
    // if it has moved to a different package in the updated dependency.
    // If so, update the import statement accordingly.

    // Your existing code using sink and renderingContext goes here.
}
```

The proposed patch removes the specific package import for the `RenderingContext` class and replaces it with a more general import statement for the `Sink` interface. This allows the code to be more flexible and work with different versions of the dependency.

Note that this patch assumes that the `RenderingContext` class is still available in the updated dependency, but has simply moved to a different package. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to use a different class or interface that provides similar functionality.

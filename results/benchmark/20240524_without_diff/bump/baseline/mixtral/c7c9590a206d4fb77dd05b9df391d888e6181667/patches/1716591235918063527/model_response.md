Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public void execute()
    throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        generate( sink, locale );
    }
    catch ( Exception e ) // changed MavenReportException to Exception
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

The change is to replace `MavenReportException` with `Exception` in the `catch` block. This will allow the code to compile even if the `MavenReportException` class is no longer available. However, this change may result in catching more exceptions than intended, so it's important to verify that the exception handling is still appropriate for the specific exception types that can be thrown.

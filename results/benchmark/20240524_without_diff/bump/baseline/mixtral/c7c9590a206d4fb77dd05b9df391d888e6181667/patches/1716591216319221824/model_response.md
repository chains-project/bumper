Here's a possible patch for the given code. This patch assumes that the issue is caused by a missing or incorrect import statement for the `MavenReportException` class.

```java
import org.apache.maven.plugins.reporting.MavenReportException;

@Override
public void execute()
    throws MojoExecutionException
{
    if ( !canGenerateReport() )
    {
        getLog().info( "Skipping SCoverage report generation" );
        return;
    }

    try
    {
        RenderingContext context = new RenderingContext( outputDirectory, getOutputName() + ".html" );
        SiteRendererSink sink = new SiteRendererSink( context );
        Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
        generate( sink, locale );
    }
    catch ( MavenReportException e )
    {
        String prefix = "An error has occurred in " + getName( Locale.ENGLISH ) + " report generation";
        throw new MojoExecutionException( prefix + ": " + e.getMessage(), e );
    }
}
```

If this import statement is already present in the code, then the issue may be caused by a missing or incorrect dependency in the project's `pom.xml` file. In that case, you may need to add or update the dependency for the library that contains the missing class. However, since the original error message only mentions a "cannot find symbol" error without specifying which symbol is missing, it's difficult to provide a specific solution for this issue.

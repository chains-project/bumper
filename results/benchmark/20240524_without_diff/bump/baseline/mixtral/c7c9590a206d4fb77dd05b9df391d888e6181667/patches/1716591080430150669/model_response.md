Here's a fixed version of the method that should resolve the issue:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    try {
        sink = createSink();
        sink.head();

        if (getLog().isDebugEnabled()) {
            sink.comment("Debug info");
        }

        sink.title();
        sink.text(getReportTitle());
        sink.title_();

        sink.head_();

        sink.body();

        if (getLog().isDebugEnabled()) {
            sink.comment("Debug info");
        }

        sink.section1();
        sink.text(getReportTitle());
        sink.section1_();

        sink.body_();

        sink.flush();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to generate report", e);
    }
}
```

The org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render package has been removed, so we need to replace the usage of the RenderingContext class with the Sink class from the org.apache.maven.doxia.sink package. The Sink class provides similar functionality for generating HTML content.

Note that some of the method calls on the RenderingContext object have been removed, as they are not directly related to generating the report content. If these are necessary for your use case, you may need to add them back using the appropriate Sink methods.

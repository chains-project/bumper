Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.sink.Sink;

// ...

@Override
public void executeReport(Locale locale) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
    Sink sink = renderingContext.getDocument();
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `RenderingContext` class with `Sink`, which is an added class in the Doxia library. The `RenderingContext` class seems to be removed in the new version, so we can't use it anymore. Instead, we can use the `Sink` class to get the document.

Note that this patch assumes that the `renderingContext` variable is already defined and initialized in the `executeReport` method. If it's not, you may need to modify the code to initialize it.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(^|\\.)(?<package>[^.]+)\\.([^.]+\\.class)$");
    for (String packageToScan : packagesToScan.split(",")) {
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
        while (matcher.find()) {
            if (packageToScan.equals(matcher.group("package"))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
The failure is caused by the use of the `FilterBuilder` class, which might have been removed from the external dependency. To fix this, we can use a regular expression to match the package names instead of relying on the `FilterBuilder` class.

The regular expression `pattern` matches strings in the format `<package>.<class>`, where `<package>` is the package name and `<class>` is the class name with the `.class` extension. The `Matcher` object is used to search for the regular expression pattern in the input string `s`.

If the package name in `packageToScan` matches the package name in the input string, the method returns `true`. If no match is found, the method returns `false`.

Note that the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes are part of the `java.util.regex` package, which is a built-in package in Java and should be available in any Java environment.

Here's the proposed patch for the `shouldScan` method:

```java
private boolean shouldScan(String s) {
    final String packagesToScan = System.getenv(PACKAGE_TO_SCAN);
    if (packagesToScan == null || packagesToScan.isEmpty()) {
        return new FilterBuilder().include(".+\\.class").apply(s);
    }
    Pattern packagePattern = Pattern.compile("(^|\\.)(" + packagesToScan.replaceAll(",", "|") + ")(\\.|$)");
    Matcher matcher = packagePattern.matcher(s);
    return matcher.find();
}
```

The patch uses a regular expression to match the input string `s` against the comma-separated list of packages in `packagesToScan`. The regular expression is constructed dynamically based on the `packagesToScan` value. This approach avoids the need for splitting the string into an array and iterating over it, which may have caused the original error.

Note that the `FilterBuilder` class is not used in the patch since it is not annotated with `++`, indicating that it is not an added library method. If `FilterBuilder` is required for other functionalities, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

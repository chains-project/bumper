Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepository = GlobalConfig.getLanguageSupportRepository();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setEnabledLanguages(languageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode())
            .build();
}
```

This patch creates a new variable `languageSupportRepository` to hold a reference to the `LanguageSupportRepository` instance, which has the `getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode()` method that can be used instead of the removed `getEnabledLanguages()` method. The `addEnabledLanguages()` method is also removed, so it is not called in the patched code. The `Override` decorator is not necessary and has been removed.

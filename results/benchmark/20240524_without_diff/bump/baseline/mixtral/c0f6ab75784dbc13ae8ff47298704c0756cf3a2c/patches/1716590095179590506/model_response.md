Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    PropertyReader propertyReader = new PropertyReader();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(propertyReader.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(propertyReader.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(propertyReader.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(propertyReader.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(propertyReader.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

In this patch, I've introduced a new `PropertyReader` class that reads the necessary properties from a configuration file or some other external source. This allows us to remove the dependency on the `globalConfig` object, which seems to be causing the error.

Note that the `PropertyReader` class is not provided here, and you will need to implement it yourself based on your specific use case. However, this should give you a starting point for fixing the failing code.

Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepository = GlobalConfig.instance().getLanguageSupportRepository();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setEnabledLanguages(languageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode())
            .build();
}
```
In this patch, we create a new variable `languageSupportRepository` to hold an instance of `LanguageSupportRepository`, which has the new `getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode()` method. We then use this method to get the enabled languages and pass them to the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder`. Note that we no longer need to call `addEnabledLanguages()`, as the new `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` has no such method.

Also note that we removed the `@Override` decorator from the method, as it is no longer overriding any method in the new version.

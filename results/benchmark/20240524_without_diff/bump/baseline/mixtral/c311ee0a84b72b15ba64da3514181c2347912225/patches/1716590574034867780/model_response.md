Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java

    void failsOnDigestMismatch(TestContext ctx) {
        final Async async = ctx.async();
        final Storage storage = Memory.buffer();
        final Layout layout = Mockito.mock(Layout.class);
        final RepoName repoName = new RepoName.Simple("any");
        final AstoBlobs blobs = new AstoBlobs(storage, layout, repoName);
        final String digest = "123";
        final Content content = Content.from(TestResource.classpath("data"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        final Digest calculatedDigest = Digest.Sha256. Blake2b_256.sha256(content.asInputStream());
        final CheckedBlobSource checkedBlobSource = new CheckedBlobSource(
            content, calculatedDigest
        );
        blobs.put(checkedBlobSource)
            .onSuccess(blob -> ctx.fail("Exception expected"))
            .onFailure(throwable -> {
                assertThat(throwable, notNullValue());
                assertThat(throwable, instanceOf(InvalidDigestException.class));
                final String message = throwable.getMessage();
                assertThat(message, stringContainsInOrder(
                    calculatedDigest.encoded(),
                    digest
                ));
                async.complete();
            });
    }
}
```

Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    String format = "Status: Downloaded newer image for %s";
    return new CoreMatchers.<String>containsString(String.format(format, image));
}
```

This patch defines a variable `format` to hold the format string, and then uses that variable in the call to `String.format()`. This should resolve the "identifier expected" error by providing a valid identifier for the format string.

Note that this patch does not make any assumptions about which library methods have been added or removed, and should be compatible with both the old and new versions of the external dependency. It also does not change the method signature or remove the `@Override` decorator.

Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.anything());
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.anything(), startsWith)
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the `Matcher.anything()` method, which was added in the new library version, to replace the `false` value that was causing the error. The `startsWith` variable is used to store the result of the `contains` method, which checks if the `Location` header value starts with the expected prefix. This allows us to use the `StringStartsWith` constructor with the correct number of arguments.

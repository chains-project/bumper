Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(new StringStartsWith(startsWith), "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value `false`. Then, I used this variable as the argument for the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This way, the constructor will receive only one argument, which is required by the new library version.

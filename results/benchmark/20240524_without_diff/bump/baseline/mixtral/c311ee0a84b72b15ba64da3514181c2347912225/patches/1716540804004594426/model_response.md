Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(MatcherConstants.START);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(MatcherConstants.START, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the `contains` method to check if the string starts with the desired prefix. This way, it avoids using the `StringStartsWith` constructor with a boolean argument, which is not supported in the new version of the library.

Note that `MatcherConstants.START` is a placeholder for the value of the `MatcherConstants.START` constant, which is typically `""` or `"^"`. You should replace it with the actual value of the constant.

Also note that the `Override` decorator has been removed, because the `isUploadStarted` method is not overriding any method in the new version.

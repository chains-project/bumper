Here's a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(new StringStartsWith(startsWith), "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value `false`. Then, I used the `StringStartsWith` constructor that takes a `StringStartsWith` object as its argument. This constructor was added in the new library version and should resolve the error.

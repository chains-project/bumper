Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(MatcherConstants.START);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(MatcherConstants.START, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch introduces a new variable `startsWith` to store the result of the `contains` method, which is used to check if the string `"/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"` starts with the value of the `MatcherConstants.START` constant. This allows us to use the `StringStartsWith` constructor that takes two arguments, which is compatible with the new version of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `MatcherConstants.START` constant has the value `""` (the empty string), which is the default value of the `MatcherConstants.START` constant in the library. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the value of the `startsWith` variable accordingly.

Here is a fixed version of the failing method:

```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionWhenDigestIsAbsent() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        Assertions.assertThrows(
            IllegalStateException.class,
            () -> new UploadEntity.Request(
                new RequestLine(
                    RqMethod.PUT,
                    "/v2/my-repo/blobs/uploads/123-abc?what=nothing"
                ).toString()
            ).digest()
        ).getMessage(),
        new StringStartsWith("Unexpected query")
    );
}
```

In the original code, the `StringContains` matcher is used incorrectly with two arguments, while it should only have one. The new version of the library may not support this usage, so I changed it to `StringStartsWith` which only requires one argument.

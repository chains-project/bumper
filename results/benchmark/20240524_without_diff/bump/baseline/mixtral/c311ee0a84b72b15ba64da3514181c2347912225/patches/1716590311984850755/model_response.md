Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Downloaded newer image for"
    );
}
```

In this patch, we added a third argument `"Downloaded newer image for"` to the `StringContains` constructor. This new argument is a substring that we expect to find in the target string.

The `StringContains` constructor with three arguments was added in Hamcrest version 1.3. This constructor is not present in earlier versions of Hamcrest.

By adding this third argument, we can avoid the compilation error caused by the missing constructor in earlier versions of Hamcrest.

Note that this patch assumes that the target string will always contain the substring `"Downloaded newer image for"` followed by the image name. If this assumption is not valid, this patch may not work correctly.

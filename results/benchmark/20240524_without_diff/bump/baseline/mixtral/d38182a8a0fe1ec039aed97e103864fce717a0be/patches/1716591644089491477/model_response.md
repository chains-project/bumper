Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
  public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(new Authentication.User("alice"));
  }
```
In this patch, I added the `Optional.ofNullable` method to wrap the creation of the `Authentication.User` object. This method returns an empty `Optional` if the given value is `null`, which can prevent a `NullPointerException` from being thrown if the `Authentication.User` constructor expects a non-null argument.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Authentication.User` constructor can handle a null argument without throwing an exception. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Also note that the `@Override` annotation is still present in the patch. This is because the method is still overriding a method in the superclass or interface, and removing the annotation would cause a compile error.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
    Authentication.User user = new Authentication.User("alice");
    return Optional.of(user);
}
```

This patch creates a variable `user` to store the new `Authentication.User` object, which may help make the code easier to understand. It also explicitly initializes the `Optional` object with the `user` variable, which may help avoid any issues with implicit conversions or automatic unwrapping.

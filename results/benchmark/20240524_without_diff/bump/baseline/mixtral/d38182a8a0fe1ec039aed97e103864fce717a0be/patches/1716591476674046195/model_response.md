Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
  @Test
    void testScope() {
        final String line = "GET /resource.txt HTTP/1.1";
        final String action = "foo:bar:baz";
        final AtomicReference<String> caction = new AtomicReference<>();
        final AtomicReference<String> cline = new AtomicReference<>();
        new AuthScopeSlice(
            new ScopeSlice() {
                @Override
                public Scope scope(final String rqline) {
                    cline.set(rqline);
                    return new Scope.FromString(action);
                }

                @Override
                public Response response(
                    final String line,
                    final Iterable<Map.Entry<String, String>> headers,
                    final Publisher<ByteBuffer> body
                ) {
                    return StandardRs.OK;
                }
            },
            (headers, rqline) -> CompletableFuture.completedFuture(
                new AuthScheme.Result() {
                    @Override
                    public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
                        return Optional.of(new Authentication.User("alice"));
                    }

                    @Override
                    public String challenge() {
                        return "";
                    }
                }
            ),
            (user, act) -> {
                caction.set(act);
                return true;
            }
        ).response(line, Headers.EMPTY_ITERABLE, Content.NIL_PUBLISHER).send(
            (status, headers, body) -> CompletableFuture.allOf()
        ).toCompletableFuture().join();
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(
            "Request line passed to slice",
            cline.get(),
            new IsEqual<>(line)
        );
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(
            "Scope passed as action to permissions",
            caction.get(),
            new IsEqual<>(action)
        );
    }
```

The changes made to the original code are:

* Replaced `Headers.EMPTY` with `Headers.EMPTY_ITERABLE` in the `response` method call.
* Replaced `Content.EMPTY` with `Content.NIL_PUBLISHER` in the `response` method call.

These changes are based on the assumption that the external dependency update has removed the `Headers.EMPTY` and `Content.EMPTY` constants, and replaced them with methods that return empty iterables instead. Specifically, the `Headers.EMPTY` constant has been replaced with a method `Headers.EMPTY_ITERABLE` that returns an empty `Iterable<Map.Entry<String, String>>`, and the `Content.EMPTY` constant has been replaced with a method `Content.NIL_PUBLISHER` that returns an empty `Publisher<ByteBuffer>`.

Note that these changes may not be necessary or sufficient to fix the error, depending on the specifics of the external dependency update. However, they should at least help to resolve the "cannot find symbol" error by removing the references to the missing constants.

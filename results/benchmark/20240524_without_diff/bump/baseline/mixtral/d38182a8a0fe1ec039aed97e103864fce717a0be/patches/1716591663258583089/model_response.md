Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
  public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(new Authentication.User("alice"));
  }
```
In this patch, I added `Optional.ofNullable()` to wrap the creation of the `Authentication.User` object. This method returns an empty `Optional` if the given value is `null`, which could be the case if the external dependency is not providing the expected value.

Note that I didn't change the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as the method is still overriding a method in the new version. I also didn't use any removed library methods or added new ones.

This patch should fix the error message you provided, but there might be other issues in the code that need to be addressed.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(new Authentication.User("alice"));
}
```

This patch uses `Optional.ofNullable` instead of `Optional.of` to wrap the `Authentication.User` object. This is because `Optional.of` throws a `NullPointerException` if the argument is `null`, whereas `Optional.ofNullable` returns an empty `Optional` in that case.

Although the error message suggests that a symbol cannot be found, it's possible that the failure is caused by a change in the behavior of a dependent library method. By using `Optional.ofNullable` instead of `Optional.of`, we can ensure that the method handles `null` values gracefully and doesn't throw a `NullPointerException` even if the behavior of a dependent library method has changed.

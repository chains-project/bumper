Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
  @Override
  public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(new Authentication.User("alice"));
  }
```

In this patch, we changed the `Optional.of` method to `Optional.ofNullable`. This is because the `of` method throws a `NullPointerException` if the provided argument is `null`. In this case, since the error message suggests that a symbol cannot be found, it's possible that the `Authentication.User` constructor is throwing an exception.

By using `Optional.ofNullable`, we ensure that if the constructor throws an exception, the `Optional` will be empty, and the code will not throw a `NullPointerException`. This should fix the error message you provided.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Authentication.User` constructor can throw an exception. If that's not the case, then the original code should work fine, and the error message may be caused by a different issue.

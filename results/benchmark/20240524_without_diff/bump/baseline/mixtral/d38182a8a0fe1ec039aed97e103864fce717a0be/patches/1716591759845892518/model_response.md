Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@Override
public Optional<Authentication.User> user() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(new Authentication.User("alice"));
}
```

In this patch, we changed `Optional.of` to `Optional.ofNullable`, so that if `new Authentication.User("alice")` returns `null`, it won't throw a `NullPointerException`. This can happen if the `Authentication.User` constructor has changed in the new version of the external dependency, and now returns `null` instead of throwing an exception.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Authentication.User` class still has a constructor that takes a `String` argument. If that constructor has been removed, then the patch would need to be adjusted accordingly.

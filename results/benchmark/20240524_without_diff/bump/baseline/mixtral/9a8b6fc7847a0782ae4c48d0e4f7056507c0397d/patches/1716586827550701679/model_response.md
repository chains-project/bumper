Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.DigestPasswordEncoder;

//...

@Override
public String encodePassword(String rawPass, Object salt) throws Exception {
    DigestPasswordEncoder encoder = new DigestPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder.encodePassword(rawPass, (String) salt);
}
```
This patch replaces the missing `PasswordEncoder` class from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with the `DigestPasswordEncoder` class from `org.jasypt.util.password`. The `encodePassword` method has been updated to use the new encoder class and to cast the salt object to a string.

Note that this patch assumes that the `salt` object passed to the `encodePassword` method is always a string. If this is not the case, the casting of `salt` to a string may need to be modified.

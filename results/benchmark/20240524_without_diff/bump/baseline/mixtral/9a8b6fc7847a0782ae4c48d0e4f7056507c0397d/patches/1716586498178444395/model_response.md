Here's a possible patch for the issue:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public String encode(String rawPassword) {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return textEncryptor.encrypt(rawPassword);
}
```

Note that this patch replaces the use of the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package with the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package. This should resolve the issue with the missing package.

Additionally, the `encode` method has been updated to use the new `BasicTextEncryptor` class and its methods. The `salt` parameter has been removed since it is not used in this implementation. The `password` parameter is still used to set the encryption password for the `BasicTextEncryptor` object.

This patch assumes that the `password` parameter is still being set properly in the enclosing class. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be updated accordingly.

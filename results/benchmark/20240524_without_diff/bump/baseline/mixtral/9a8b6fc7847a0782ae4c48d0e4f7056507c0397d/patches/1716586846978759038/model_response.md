Here's a possible patch for the given error. I'm assuming that the issue is caused by a missing dependency in the project's configuration. Therefore, I'll add an import statement for the missing package and initialize a new instance of the `PasswordEncoder` class.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and the actual fix might depend on the specifics of your project's configuration and dependencies.

```java
import org.jasypt.password.PasswordEncoder;

// ...

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new PasswordEncoder() {
        @Override
        public String encode(String rawPass) {
            // Implement the encoding logic here
            return null;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean matches(String rawPass, String encodedPass) {
            // Implement the matching logic here
            return false;
        }
    };
}
```

This code imports the `PasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.password` package and creates a new instance of it. The `passwordEncoder()` method now returns this new instance.

You'll need to replace the `// Implement the encoding logic here` and `// Implement the matching logic here` comments with the actual implementation for your project.

Again, please note that this is just one possible solution, and the actual fix might depend on the specifics of your project's configuration and dependencies.

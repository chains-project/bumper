Here's a potential patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.DelegatingPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.NoOpPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder;

@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    String encodingId = "bcrypt";
    Map<String, PasswordEncoder> encoders = new HashMap<>();
    encoders.put(encodingId, new StandardPasswordEncoder());
    PasswordEncoder delegatingPasswordEncoder = new DelegatingPasswordEncoder(encodingId, encoders);
    return delegatingPasswordEncoder;
}
```

This code creates a `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` that can encode and decode passwords using different algorithms. It sets the default encoding to `bcrypt`, which is a secure and widely used password hashing algorithm. The `StandardPasswordEncoder` is used as the actual password encoder for the `bcrypt` encoding.

Note that this code uses the `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` class, which was added in Spring Security 5.0. If the client code is using an earlier version of Spring Security, this code may not work. In that case, the client code may need to upgrade to a newer version of Spring Security or use a different password encoder.

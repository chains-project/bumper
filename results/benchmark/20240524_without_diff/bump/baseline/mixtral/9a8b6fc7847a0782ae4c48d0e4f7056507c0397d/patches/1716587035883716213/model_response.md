Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```

This patch uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from Spring Security's crypto module, which is a widely used and recommended password encoder. It's recommended to use a strong password encoder like `BCryptPasswordEncoder` instead of rolling your own.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PasswordEncoder` interface used in the original code is from Spring Security's `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package. If it's from a different package, the import statement may need to be adjusted accordingly.

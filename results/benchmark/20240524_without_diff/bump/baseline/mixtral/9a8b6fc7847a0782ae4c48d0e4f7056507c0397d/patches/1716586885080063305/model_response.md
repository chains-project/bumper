Here's a possible patch for the given error. This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `PasswordEncoder` class directly from the `jasypt` package.
```java
import org.jasypt.PasswordEncoder;
```
In the new version of the library, the `PasswordEncoder` class is no longer located under the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package, but instead under the top-level `org.jasypt` package.

This patch should fix the error by importing the correct version of the `PasswordEncoder` class.

Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncoder;

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    ConfigurablePasswordEncoder encoder = new ConfigurablePasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setAlgorithm("SHA-256");
    encoder.setIterations(1024);
    return encoder;
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` with `org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncoder`, which is an alternative class that provides similar functionality. Additionally, the patch sets the algorithm and iterations for the encoder, as was done in the original code. Note that the `PasswordEncoder` interface is no longer used, but the method signature remains unchanged.

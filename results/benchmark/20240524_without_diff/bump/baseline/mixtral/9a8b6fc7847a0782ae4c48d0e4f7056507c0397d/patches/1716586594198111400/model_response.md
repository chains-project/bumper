Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
    super.afterPropertiesSet();
    textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
}
```
In this patch, we import the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `org.jasypt.util.text` package, which is a replacement for the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package.

In the `afterPropertiesSet()` method, we initialize the `textEncryptor` variable by creating a new instance of `BasicTextEncryptor` and setting its password to the value of the `password` variable. This is similar to what was done in the original code, but with the replacement class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` variable is already defined and initialized in the class. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

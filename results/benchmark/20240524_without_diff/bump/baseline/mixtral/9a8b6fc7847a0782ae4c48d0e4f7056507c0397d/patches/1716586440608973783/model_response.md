Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

@Override
public final PBEPasswordEncoder getPasswordEncoder() {
    StrongTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder() {
        @Override
        public String encode(String rawPass) {
            return textEncryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean matches(String encPass, String rawPass) {
            return textEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPass, encPass);
        }
    };
}
```

This patch replaces the use of the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` class with the `org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor` class, which provides similar functionality for encrypting and decrypting passwords.

The `getPasswordEncoder()` method has been updated to create a new `StrongTextEncryptor` object, set its encryption algorithm and password, and then return a custom `PBEPasswordEncoder` object that uses the `StrongTextEncryptor` object to encrypt and decrypt passwords.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` variable is defined and accessible in the scope of the `getPasswordEncoder()` method. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public String encode(String rawPass) {
    BasicTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(this.password);
    return textEncryptor.encrypt(rawPass);
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from `org.jasypt.spring.security` with `BasicTextEncryptor` class from `org.jasypt.util.text`. The `encode` method is modified accordingly to use the new class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `password` instance variable is available in the class. If not, you may need to modify the code to initialize it before using it.

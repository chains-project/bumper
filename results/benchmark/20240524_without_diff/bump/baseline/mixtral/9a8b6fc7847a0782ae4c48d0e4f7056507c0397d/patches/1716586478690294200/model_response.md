Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder getPasswordEncoder() {
    StrongTextEncryptor encryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();
    encryptor.setAlgorithm("PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES");
    encryptor.setPassword("your-secret-key"); // replace with your secret key
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(encryptor.getAlgorithm(), encryptor.getPassword().toCharArray(), 4096, 32);
}
```

In this patch, we use the `StrongTextEncryptor` class from the `jasypt` library as a replacement for the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class. The `StrongTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to `PBEPasswordEncoder`, so we can use it to encrypt and decode passwords.

Note that you'll need to replace the `"your-secret-key"` placeholder with your own secret key. The secret key should be kept secret and not shared with anyone.

Also note that we had to add the `jasypt-1.9.3.jar` library to the project's classpath to resolve the missing package error. You can download this library from the Maven repository at <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot-starter/3.0.2>.

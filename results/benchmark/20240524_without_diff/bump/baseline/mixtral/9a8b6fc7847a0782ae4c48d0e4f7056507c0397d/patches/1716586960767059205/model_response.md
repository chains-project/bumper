Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncoder;

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    ConfigurablePasswordEncoder encoder = new ConfigurablePasswordEncoder();
    encoder.setAlgorithm("SHA-256");
    encoder.setIterations(1024);
    return encoder;
}
```

This patch replaces the original `PasswordEncoder` import with the appropriate `ConfigurablePasswordEncoder` import from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package. The `passwordEncoder()` method has been updated accordingly to use the new `ConfigurablePasswordEncoder` class.

Note that the `ConfigurablePasswordEncoder` class is part of the jasypt library, and it provides similar functionality to the `PasswordEncoder` interface from the `org.jasypt.spring.security` package, which seems to be unavailable or missing in the current environment.

Additionally, the `ConfigurablePasswordEncoder` class has been available since jasypt version 1.9, so this patch should work for any version that includes that class.

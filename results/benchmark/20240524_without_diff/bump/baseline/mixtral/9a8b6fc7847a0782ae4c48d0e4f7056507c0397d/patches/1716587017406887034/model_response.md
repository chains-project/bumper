Here's a fixed version of the method that takes into account the added library method `StandardPasswordEncoder` (assuming that the external dependency updated the password encoding library):

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder;

@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder encoder = new StandardPasswordEncoder();
    return encoder;
}
```

This solution uses the `StandardPasswordEncoder` class introduced in Spring Security 5.x, which replaced the deprecated `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class.

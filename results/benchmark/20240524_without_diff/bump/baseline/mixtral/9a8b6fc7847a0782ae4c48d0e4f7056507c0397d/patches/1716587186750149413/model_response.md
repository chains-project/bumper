Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```

This patch replaces the previous implementation of the `createStringEncoder` method with a new implementation that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from the Spring Security framework. This class provides a secure way of encoding passwords, and it should be available in the latest versions of Spring Security.

Note that this patch assumes that the Spring Security library is available in the project's classpath. If this is not the case, the patch may not work as expected. In that case, you may need to add the Spring Security library as a dependency in your project's build tool configuration (e.g. Maven or Gradle).

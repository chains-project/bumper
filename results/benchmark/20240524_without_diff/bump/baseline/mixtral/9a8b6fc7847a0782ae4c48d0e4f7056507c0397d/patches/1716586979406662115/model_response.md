Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.DigestPasswordEncoder;

//...

@Override
public String encodePassword(String rawPass, Object salt) throws Exception {
    DigestPasswordEncoder encoder = new DigestPasswordEncoder("SHA-256", 1000);
    return encoder.encodePassword(rawPass, (String) salt);
}
```
In this patch, we have replaced the import statement for `PasswordEncoder` with the one for `DigestPasswordEncoder`, which is a part of the `jasypt-util` library. We have also modified the `encodePassword` method to use `DigestPasswordEncoder` instead of `PasswordEncoder`.

Note that `DigestPasswordEncoder` does not have the same methods as `PasswordEncoder`, so we have had to modify the method signature slightly. Specifically, we have removed the `collection` parameter, which was not being used in the original method.

Additionally, we have set the encryption algorithm to `SHA-256` and the iteration count to `1000`, which are the defaults for `PasswordEncoder` in the version of `jasypt` that the client code was originally written for. If these defaults are not appropriate for the client's use case, they may need to be adjusted.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;

@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```

This patch replaces the failing code with a new implementation that uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from the Spring Security library. This class provides a secure way to encode and verify passwords.

Note that the `setPasswordEncryptor` method is not used in this new implementation. This is because the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class does not provide a method to set an external password encryptor. Instead, it generates a random salt for each password and encodes the salted password using the BCrypt hashing algorithm.

Also note that the `PasswordEncoder` interface is still used in the method signature, as required by the original code. This allows the client code to be used with any implementation of the `PasswordEncoder` interface.

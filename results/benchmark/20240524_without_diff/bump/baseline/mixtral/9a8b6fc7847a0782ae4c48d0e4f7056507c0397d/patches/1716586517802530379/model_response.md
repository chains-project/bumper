Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.BasicTextEncryptor;

@Override
public void init() {
    textEncryptor = new BasicTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the package `org.jasypt.spring.security` does not exist. This suggests that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class from the `jasypt-spring-security` library is no longer available.

To fix the error, we can use the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `jasypt` library instead. The `BasicTextEncryptor` class provides similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class.

In the provided code, the `init()` method initializes a `PBEPasswordEncoder` object. We can modify this method to initialize a `BasicTextEncryptor` object instead.

Note that the `BasicTextEncryptor` class does not have a `setPassword(String)` method like the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class. Instead, we can set the password using the `setPassword(String)` method of the `TextEncryptor` interface, which the `BasicTextEncryptor` class implements.

Therefore, we can modify the `init()` method as follows:

* Import the `BasicTextEncryptor` class from the `jasypt` library.
* Declare a `BasicTextEncryptor` object `textEncryptor`.
* Set the password using the `setTextEncryptor(String)` method of the `TextEncryptor` interface.
* Remove the `@Override` annotation if the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

With these changes, the `init()` method should work as before, but without relying on the `jasypt-spring-security` library.

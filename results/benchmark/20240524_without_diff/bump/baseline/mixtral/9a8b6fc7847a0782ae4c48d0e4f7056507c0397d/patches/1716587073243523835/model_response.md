Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```

This patch uses the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class from the Spring Security library to create a new password encoder. This class is a good replacement for the `StrongPasswordEncryptor` class because it provides strong password encryption and is widely used in Spring applications.

Note that this patch assumes that the Spring Security library is already included as a dependency in the project. If this is not the case, you may need to add it as a dependency before this patch can be applied.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.StrongTextEncryptor;

@Override
public final PBEPasswordEncoder getPasswordEncoder() {
    StrongTextEncryptor textEncryptor = new StrongTextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(algorithm, textEncryptor.getEngine(), encodingScheme);
}
```

In this patch, we replace the missing package `org.jasypt.spring.security` with `org.jasypt.util.text`. We also change the import statement accordingly.

We create a new instance of `StrongTextEncryptor` and set its password using the `setPassword` method. Then, we create a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance by passing the encryption algorithm, the encryption engine from `textEncryptor`, and the encoding scheme.

Note that we cannot use the `PBEPasswordEncoder` constructor with the original signature since the `textEncryptor` instance does not implement the `PasswordEncoder` interface. Therefore, we have to create a new constructor for `PBEPasswordEncoder` that takes the encryption algorithm, the encryption engine, and the encoding scheme as arguments.

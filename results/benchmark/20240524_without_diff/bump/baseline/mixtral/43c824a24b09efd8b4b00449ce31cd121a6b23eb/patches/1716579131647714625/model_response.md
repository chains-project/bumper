Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (Object instance : instances) {
        if (instance instanceof JsonNode) {
          JsonNode node = (JsonNode) instance;
          if (!node.isMissingNode() && !node.isNull()) {
            values.add(node.asText());
          }
        }
      }
    return values;
}
```

This patch assumes that the `JsonPathCache` returns a list of `JsonNode` objects instead of `XmlFieldInstance` objects. It checks if each instance is a non-null and non-missing `JsonNode` before attempting to extract its text value.

Note that this patch may not be complete or correct, as it depends on the context and the specific version of the external dependency that is causing the failure. It is only a best effort attempt based on the provided information.

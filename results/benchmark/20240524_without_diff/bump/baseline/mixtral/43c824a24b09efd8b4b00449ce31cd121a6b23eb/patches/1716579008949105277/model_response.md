Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

// Add the following import statement
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonPathUtils;

// Modify the following line
// JsonBranch branch = JsonPathUtils.getBranch(json, path);
// To
JsonBranch branch = JsonPathUtils.getBranch(json, path, JsonBranch.class);
```

This patch imports the `JsonPathUtils` class and modifies the `getBranch` method call to include the expected return type, which was added in a later version of the library.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

try {
    // Your import might be causing issues due to a broken dependency update
    // You can try using the fully qualified name instead
    JsonBranch branch = new de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch();
    // Use the 'branch' object here
} catch (NoClassDefFoundError e) {
    // If the issue persists, you might need to handle the exception
    // and add a fallback or error message
    System.err.println("Failed to initialize JsonBranch: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

This patch uses the fully qualified name for the `JsonBranch` class, which might help if the import statement is causing issues due to a broken dependency update. Additionally, a `try-catch` block is added to handle the `NoClassDefFoundError` that might occur if the issue persists. This allows the code to continue executing without crashing, and you can add a fallback or error message.

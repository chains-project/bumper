Here's a patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld.JsonBranch;
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `JsonBranch` cannot be found, which means that the class `JsonBranch` cannot be located in the specified package `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json`. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a version update or a change in the package structure of the external dependency.

To fix this issue, we need to locate the correct package and import it into the client code. In this case, the correct package for the `JsonBranch` class appears to be `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld`. Therefore, we can replace the incorrect import statement with the correct one:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld.JsonBranch;
```
This should resolve the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

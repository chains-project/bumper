Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, DataElement branch) {
  List<XmlFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
  List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
  if (instances != null)
    for (XmlFieldInstance instance : instances)
      values.add(instance.getValue());
  return values;
}
```

In this patch, I changed the type of the `branch` parameter from `JsonBranch` to `DataElement`, since the `JsonBranch` class is no longer available in the new library version. I also changed the method call `branch.getJsonPath()` to `branch.getJsonPath()` since both methods have the same name and return type in the new library version.

Here is a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = cache.getObjects(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (Object instance : instances)
        if (instance instanceof JsonNode)
          values.add(((JsonNode) instance).textValue());
    return values;
}
```
This patch assumes that the failure is caused by a change in the `JsonPathCache` class, which now returns a list of `Object` instead of a list of `XmlFieldInstance`. It also assumes that the `JsonNode` class (which is part of the Jackson library) is available and can be used to extract the text value of a JSON node. If this is not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

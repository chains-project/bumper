Here's a possible patch for the given code. I'm assuming that the issue is caused by a missing dependency for `XmlFieldInstance`. I'm replacing it with a simple `String` class.

```java
  private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<String> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (String instance : instances)
        values.add(instance);
    return values;
  }
```

This code should resolve the compilation error by using a `List<String>` throughout the method instead of the missing `XmlFieldInstance` class. However, this solution might not be suitable if the original behavior of the `XmlFieldInstance.getValue()` method is crucial for the proper functioning of the application. In that case, you would need to find a proper alternative or re-add the missing dependency.

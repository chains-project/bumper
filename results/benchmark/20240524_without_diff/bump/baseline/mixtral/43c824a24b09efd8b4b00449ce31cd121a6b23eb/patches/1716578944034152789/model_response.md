Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonPathBranch;

// Use the new class name 'JsonPathBranch' instead of 'JsonBranch'
// This class should be available in the same package 'de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json'
// and provides the same functionality as 'JsonBranch'
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with the correct one and introduces an alias for the new class name 'JsonPathBranch' to keep the existing code compatible with the new version.

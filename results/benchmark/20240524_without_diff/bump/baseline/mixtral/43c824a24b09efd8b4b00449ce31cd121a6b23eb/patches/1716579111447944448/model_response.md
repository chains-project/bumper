Here's a possible patch for the given code. This patch checks if the `instances` variable is not null before calling the `get` method on `cache`.

```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    if (cache == null) {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
    List<XmlFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (XmlFieldInstance instance : instances)
        values.add(instance.getValue());
    return values;
}
```

This patch ensures that the code does not fail with a `NullPointerException` if `cache` is null. If `cache` is null, the method returns an empty list. This way, the code does not fail with a `NullPointerException` and can continue executing.

Note that I assumed that the `NullPointerException` is caused by calling `cache.get(branch.getJsonPath())` when `cache` is null. If the `NullPointerException` is caused by a different variable, the patch might need to be adjusted accordingly.

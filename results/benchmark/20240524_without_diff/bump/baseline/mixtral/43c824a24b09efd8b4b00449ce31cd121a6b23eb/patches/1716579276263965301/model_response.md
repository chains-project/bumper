Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private static String extractFirst(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
  List<Object> list = extractList(cache, branch);
  if (!list.isEmpty()) {
    Object first = list.get(0);
    if (first instanceof String) {
      return (String) first;
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

This patch changes the type of the `list` variable from `List<String>` to `List<Object>`, so that it can handle cases where the elements of the list are not strings. It also checks the type of the first element of the list before returning it, to make sure it is a string.

This patch should fix the error by making the code more robust to changes in the external dependency. It does not rely on the assumption that the elements of the list are always strings, so it should work even if the dependency changes and starts returning different types of objects.

Note that this patch does not use any removed library methods (`--`) or added library methods (`++`). It only uses standard Java syntax and built-in classes. It also does not change the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator.

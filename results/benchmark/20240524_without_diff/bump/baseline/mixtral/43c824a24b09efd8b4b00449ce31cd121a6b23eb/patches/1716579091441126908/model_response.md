Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = cache.getObjects(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (Object instance : instances)
        if (instance instanceof Map) {
          Map<?, ?> mapInstance = (Map<?, ?>) instance;
          if (mapInstance.containsKey("value")) {
            values.add((String) mapInstance.get("value"));
          }
        }
    return values;
}
```
In this patch, I changed the type of `instances` from `List<XmlFieldInstance>` to `List<Object>` and used the `getObjects` method instead of `get` to get a list of raw objects. Then, I checked if each instance is a map and if it contains a "value" key. If it does, I added the corresponding value to the `values` list.

Note that this patch assumes that the external dependency was removed and replaced with a more generic one. The new dependency may not have the `XmlFieldInstance` class or the `getValue` method, but it should have a way to get a list of raw objects and extract the desired values from them.

Also, I assumed that the added library methods have the following signatures:

* `JsonPathCache.getObjects(String)`: returns a list of raw objects for the given JSON path.
* `Map.containsKey(Object)`: returns true if the map contains a key equal to the given object.

Please make sure that the new dependency has these methods and adjust the patch accordingly.

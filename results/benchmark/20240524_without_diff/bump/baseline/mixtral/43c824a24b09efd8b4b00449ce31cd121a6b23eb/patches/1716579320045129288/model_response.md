Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
private static String extractFirst(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> list = extractList(cache, branch);
    if (list != null && !list.isEmpty())
      return (String) list.get(0);
    return null;
}
```

In this patch, we changed the type of the `list` variable from `List<String>` to `List<Object>`. This is because the external dependency update might have changed the type of the elements in the list. By changing the type to `List<Object>`, we can handle any type of element in the list. Additionally, we added a null check for the `list` variable before checking if it's empty. This is to avoid a `NullPointerException` if the `extractList` method returns null.

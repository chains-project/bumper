Here's a fixed version of the method that should resolve the issue:

```java
private static String extractFirst(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<?> list = extractList(cache, branch);
    if (list != null && !list.isEmpty()) {
        Object firstElement = list.get(0);
        if (firstElement instanceof String) {
            return (String) firstElement;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

In this version, I changed the type of the `list` variable to `List<?>` to avoid the need for a raw type warning. I also added a null check for the list before checking if it's empty. Additionally, I added a check to make sure that the first element of the list is a string before casting it. This should ensure that the code doesn't fail with a `ClassCastException` even if the first element of the list isn't a string.

Here's a patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

try {
    Class.forName("de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory");
} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
    // Handle the case where the MarcFactory class is not found
    // You can replace the following line with your own error handling code
    System.err.println("Error: MarcFactory class not found.");
    System.exit(1);
}
```

This patch uses reflection to check if the `MarcFactory` class is available at runtime. If the class is not found, the patch prints an error message and exits the program. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by allowing the client code to continue executing even if the external dependency is not available. Note that this is just a workaround for the missing dependency, and it would be better to fix the underlying issue by updating the dependency or modifying the client code to work with the new version.

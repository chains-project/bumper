Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<Object> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
        for (Object instance : instances) {
            if (instance instanceof Map) {
                Map<String, Object> mapInstance = (Map<String, Object>) instance;
                if (mapInstance.containsKey("value")) {
                    values.add((String) mapInstance.get("value"));
                }
            }
        }
    return values;
}
```

In this patch, I changed the type of the `instances` variable from `List<XmlFieldInstance>` to `List<Object>` to avoid the "cannot find symbol" error. Then, I added some checks to ensure that the instances are of the correct type (a map with a "value" key) before trying to extract the value. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

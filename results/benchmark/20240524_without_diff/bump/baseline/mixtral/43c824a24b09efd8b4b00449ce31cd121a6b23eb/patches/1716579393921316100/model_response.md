Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static String extractFirst(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<?> list = extractList(cache, branch);
    if (list != null && !list.isEmpty()) {
        Object firstElement = list.get(0);
        if (firstElement instanceof String) {
            return (String) firstElement;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

This patch assumes that the issue is caused by the fact that the `extractList` method now returns a list of objects instead of a list of strings. To handle this, the patch checks if the first element of the list is a string before returning it. If it's not a string, the method returns null.

Note that this patch uses a wildcard `?` for the list type to avoid having to import any new classes. If the list elements are known to implement a particular interface or extend a particular class, that information can be used instead.

Also note that this patch does not remove the `@Override` decorator because the method signature has not changed.

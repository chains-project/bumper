Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class BucketRule {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library in the new version.

To fix the error, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using the removed `Tv` class.

Looking at the library changes, we can see that the `Loggable` aspect has been added, which can be used to log method calls. We can use this aspect to replace the functionality of the `Tv` class.

Therefore, we can modify the `BucketRule` class to use the `Loggable` aspect instead of the `Tv` class. This will allow the code to compile and run successfully with the new library version.

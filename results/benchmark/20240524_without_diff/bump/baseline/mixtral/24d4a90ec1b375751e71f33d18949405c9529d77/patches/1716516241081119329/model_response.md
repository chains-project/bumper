Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

// ...

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
    // ...
}
```

The `Tv` class has been removed in the new library version, but the `Loggable` aspect is still available. I replaced the `Tv` import with the `Loggable` import and added the `@Loggable` annotation to the test class. This should fix the error and make the code compatible with the new library version.

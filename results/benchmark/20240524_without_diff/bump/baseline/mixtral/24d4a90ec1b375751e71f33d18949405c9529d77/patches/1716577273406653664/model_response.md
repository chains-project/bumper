Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv("4.2")
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  private S3 s3 = new S3("http://s3.amazonaws.com");
  // ...
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import statement with the `com.jcabi.s3.S3` import statement, and initialized an `S3` object using the constructor. I also added the `@Tv("4.2")` annotation to specify the required version of the library.

Note: This patch assumes that the `com.jcabi.s3` library is available in the project's classpath. If not, you may need to add it as a dependency.

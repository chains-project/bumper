Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv({"2.31.0"})
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  private S3 s3;

  public void testUseBucket() {
    s3 = new S3("http://s3.amazonaws.com");
    // ...
  }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the import statement to use `com.jcabi.s3.S3` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. I also created a new instance variable `s3` and initialized it in the `testUseBucket` method. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note: I assumed that the `Tv` annotation is not necessary for the code to work correctly. If it is, you may need to find an alternative solution.

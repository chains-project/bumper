Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
    // ...
}
```

The `Tv` class was removed from the library, but the `Loggable` aspect can be used instead. I added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, so now it will log method calls.

Please note that you may need to adjust the log level and the log target depending on your requirements. You can find more information about the `Loggable` aspect in the [library documentation](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-aspects#logging).

Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv({"4.2.0"})
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
  private S3 s3 = S3.create();
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, we've imported `com.jcabi.s3.S3` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. We've also created an instance of `S3` using the static factory method `S3.create()` and assigned it to a private instance variable `s3`. This allows us to use the `S3` API methods without relying on the `Tv` aspect.

Note that this patch assumes that the `AwsOcketITCase` class is not overriding any methods that rely on the `Tv` aspect. If the class is overriding such methods, additional changes may be necessary to make the code compile and run correctly.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.s3.Bucket;

@Tv({"1.7.11"})
public class BucketRule {
    // existing code...

    @Override
    public void testBucketCreation(Bucket bucket) throws IOException {
        // existing code...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, I have removed the problematic import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and replaced it with an import statement for `com.jcabi.s3.Bucket`. I have also added an annotation `@Tv({"1.7.11"})` to the `BucketRule` class, which indicates the version of the library that the code is compatible with.

Note that I have not changed the function signature or the implementation of the `testBucketCreation` method. I have only modified the import statements and added the `@Tv` annotation to the class.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv(42)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  private final S3 s3 = new S3();
  // ...
}
```
This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new import for the `com.jcabi.s3.S3` class, creates a new instance of `S3`, and assigns it to a new instance variable `s3`.

Note: This solution assumes that the missing symbol is a class named `S3` in the package `com.jcabi.s3`. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the import and class name accordingly.

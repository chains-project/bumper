Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a new addition in the library version. The `Loggable` aspect provides logging functionality and can be used similarly to the `Tv` aspect. The `@Loggable` annotation takes a log level as a parameter, and I set it to `DEBUG` in this example. You can adjust the log level as needed.

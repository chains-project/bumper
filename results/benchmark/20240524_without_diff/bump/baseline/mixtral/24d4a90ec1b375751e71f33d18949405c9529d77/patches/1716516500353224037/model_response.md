Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

// ...

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
    // ...
}
```

The `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, so I replaced it with another aspect from the same package, `Loggable`. The `Tv` annotation was used for logging in the original code, so `Loggable` serves the same purpose. You may need to adjust the log level in `Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)` to match the desired log level of the original code.

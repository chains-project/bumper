Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The `Tv` class was removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package in the new library version. However, the `Loggable` aspect is still available and can be used to provide similar functionality. In this case, I've added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `BucketRule` class, which will log debug-level messages for all public methods. This should provide similar functionality to the original `Tv` aspect while using only the new library methods.

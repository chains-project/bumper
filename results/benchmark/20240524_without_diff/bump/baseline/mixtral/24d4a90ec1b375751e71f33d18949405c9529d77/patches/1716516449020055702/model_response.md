Here's the fixed version of the code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
  // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. After checking the library changes, we can see that the `Tv` class has been removed. Therefore, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality.

In this case, the `Tv` class was used to enable logging for the `BucketRule` class. We can use the `Loggable` aspect from the same package to achieve the same functionality. By annotating the `BucketRule` class with `@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)`, we enable logging for the class with debug level.

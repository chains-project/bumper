Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.S3ObjectSummary;
import org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert;
import org.hamcrest.Matchers;
import java.util.List;

public class AwsOcketITCase {

    private AmazonS3 s3 = ... // Initialize AmazonS3 object

    @Test
    @Override
    public void testBucketHasFiles() throws Exception {
        List<S3ObjectSummary> objects = s3.listObjectsV2("my-bucket").getObjectSummaries();
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(objects.size(), Matchers.greaterThan(0));
    }
}
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement and the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with the necessary imports for using the AWS SDK for Java. The `testBucketHasFiles` method has been updated to use the `AmazonS3` object to list objects in the specified bucket and assert that the number of objects is greater than zero. The `Tv` class has been removed as it is not needed for this functionality.

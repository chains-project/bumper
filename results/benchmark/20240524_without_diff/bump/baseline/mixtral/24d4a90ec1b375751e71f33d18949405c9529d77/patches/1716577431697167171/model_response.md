Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.s3.Bucket;

@Tv({"0.19"})
public class BucketRule {
    private Bucket bucket;

    public void setUp() {
        bucket = new Bucket("test-bucket", new S3Client());
    }

    // ... other methods ...
}
```

This patch replaces the import statement with the correct one for the `Bucket` class in the `jcabi-s3` library. It also creates a `Bucket` instance using the `S3Client` class. The `@Tv` annotation is left unchanged, as it doesn't affect the compilation error.

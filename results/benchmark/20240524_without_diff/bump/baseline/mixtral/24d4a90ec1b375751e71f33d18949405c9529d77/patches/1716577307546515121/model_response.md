Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.s3.S3;

@Tv({"2.31.0"})
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  private S3 s3;

  public void testOcket() {
    this.s3 = new S3("us-east-1");
    // ...
  }
}
```
This patch replaces the problematic import statement and creates a new instance of `S3` class directly, instead of using the deprecated `AwsOcket` class.

Note that the version number in the `@Tv` annotation may need to be adjusted based on the actual version of `jcabi-s3` library that you are using.

Additionally, you may need to update the rest of the code in the `testOcket()` method to use the `S3` class instead of `AwsOcket`.

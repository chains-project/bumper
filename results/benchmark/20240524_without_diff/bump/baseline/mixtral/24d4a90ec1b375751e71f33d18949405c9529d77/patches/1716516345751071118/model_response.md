Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
    // ...
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This is likely because the version of the library being used has removed the `Tv` class. To fix this, we can replace the `import` statement with one that imports a different class from the same package. In this case, I have chosen the `Loggable` class as a replacement. I have also added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `BucketRule` class, which was previously using the `Tv` aspect. This should provide similar functionality to the original code, while using only classes and methods that are available in the new version of the library.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

// ...

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class BucketRule {
    // ...
}
```

The `Tv` class has been removed, but the `Loggable` aspect is still available in the new library version. Replacing `Tv` with `Loggable` should fix the error while preserving the original functionality.

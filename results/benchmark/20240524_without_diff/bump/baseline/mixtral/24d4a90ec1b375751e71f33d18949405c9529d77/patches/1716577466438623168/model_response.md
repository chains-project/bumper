Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.s3.Bucket;

@Tv({"1.0"})
public class BucketRule {
    private final Bucket bucket;

    public BucketRule(Bucket bucket) {
        this.bucket = bucket;
    }

    @Override
    public void test0001() {
        // Use the new method from the updated library
        bucket.createObject("test-key");
    }
}
```

In this patch, we've imported the `Bucket` class from the `com.jcabi.s3` package instead of the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class. We've also updated the `test0001()` method to use the `createObject()` method from the `Bucket` class instead of the removed method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Bucket` class has a `createObject()` method that can be used to create a new object in the bucket. If this method is not available or has a different name or signature, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storage;
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

Storage storage = Storages.loopback();
```
This code creates a loopback storage using the `Storages` class, which should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error. Note that the `storage` variable is declared but not used in this example. You may need to modify the rest of your code to use this variable as appropriate.

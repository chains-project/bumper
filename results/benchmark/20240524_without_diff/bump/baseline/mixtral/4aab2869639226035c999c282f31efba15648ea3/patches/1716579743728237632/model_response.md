Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

// ...

try {
  // Your existing code here
} catch (IOException e) {
  throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
}
```

In this patch, we added a try-catch block to handle the `IOException` that might be thrown when importing the `UncheckedIOException`. We catch the `IOException` and then rethrow it as an `UncheckedIOException`. This way, we can avoid the original error message and still handle the exception appropriately.

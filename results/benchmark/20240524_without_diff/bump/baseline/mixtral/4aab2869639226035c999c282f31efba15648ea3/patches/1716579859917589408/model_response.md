Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

// ...

try {
  // existing code that reads the YAML file
} catch (IOException e) {
  throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
}
```

The `UncheckedIOException` class is no longer available in the latest version of the Java standard library, so we need to replace it with a custom exception class. We can define our own `UncheckedIOException` class like this:

```java
public class UncheckedIOException extends RuntimeException {
  public UncheckedIOException(IOException e) {
    super(e);
  }
}
```

Then, we can catch the `IOException` that is thrown when reading the YAML file and wrap it in a `UncheckedIOException` before re-throwing it. This way, the calling code can still handle the exception as a runtime exception.

Note that we had to import the `IOException` class explicitly, since it is no longer imported by default in the latest version of the Java standard library.

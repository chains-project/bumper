Here is a patch that you can apply to the code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

try {
  // existing code that might throw IOException
} catch (IOException e) {
  throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
}
```
The `UncheckedIOException` class was removed in a newer version of the library, so we need to catch the `IOException` and wrap it in a `UncheckedIOException` manually.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the issue depending on the specific use case.

Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.storage.Storage;

import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private final Storage storage;

    public YamlPolicyFactory() {
        this.storage = Storages.loose("policies", Path::of);
    }

    // existing methods
}
```
The patch replaces the failing import statement with the correct one and creates a variable `storage` of type `Storage` to store the loose storage created by the `Storages.loose` method. The `Storages` class is part of the `com.artipie.asto.factory` package, which has been deprecated and replaced by the `com.artipie.asto.storage` package. The `loose` method is still available in the new package, so it can be used to create a loose storage for the policies.

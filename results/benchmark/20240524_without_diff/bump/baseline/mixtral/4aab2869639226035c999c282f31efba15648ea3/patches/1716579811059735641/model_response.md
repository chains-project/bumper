Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

try {
  // existing code that may throw IOException
} catch (IOException e) {
  throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
}
```

The patch imports `IOException` instead of `UncheckedIOException`, and adds a try-catch block to wrap any code that may throw `IOException` with a new `UncheckedIOException`. This allows the code to continue to throw an exception if an I/O error occurs, but without requiring the calling code to handle the checked exception.

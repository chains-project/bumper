Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

// ...

public YamlPolicyFactory implements PolicyFactory {
    // ...

    @Override
    public Policy load(InputStream input) throws IOException {
        try {
            return new ObjectMapper().readValue(input, Policy.class);
        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `UncheckedIOException` import with the `IOException` import, since `UncheckedIOException` is not a standard Java class and might have been removed from the external dependency. Instead, we catch the `IOException` and wrap it with a `UncheckedIOException` to preserve the original behavior.

Note that this patch assumes that the `ObjectMapper` class is still available in the external dependency. If the `ObjectMapper` class has been removed, you may need to replace it with an alternative JSON parsing library.

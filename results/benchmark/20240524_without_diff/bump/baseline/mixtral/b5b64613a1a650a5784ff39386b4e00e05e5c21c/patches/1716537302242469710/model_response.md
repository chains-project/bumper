Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.p4.client.ConnectionHelper;

private String getUrlFromClientHelper(ClientHelper clientHelper) {
    ConnectionHelper connectionHelper = new ConnectionHelper(null, null, null);
    return connectionHelper.getChangeSummary(clientHelper.getClientHead()).getDescription();
}
```

In the above code, we create a new instance of `ConnectionHelper` and use its `getChangeSummary` method to get the description of the client head, which should be the URL you're looking for. Note that we pass `null` for the first two arguments of the `ConnectionHelper` constructor since they're not used in this method.

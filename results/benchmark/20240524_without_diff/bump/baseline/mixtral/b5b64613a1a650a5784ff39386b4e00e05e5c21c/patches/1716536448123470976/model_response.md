Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAnyBlank;

// ...

if (isAnyBlank(fieldValue, defaultValue)) {
    // ...
}
```

The `isAllBlank` method has been removed from the updated library version. Instead, you can use the `isAnyBlank` method, which checks if any of the strings are blank, including null, empty, or whitespace.

In the code snippet you provided, it's not clear what the variables `fieldValue` and `defaultValue` represent. However, assuming they are strings, you can replace the `isAllBlank` method call with `isAnyBlank` to ensure the code still functions as intended.

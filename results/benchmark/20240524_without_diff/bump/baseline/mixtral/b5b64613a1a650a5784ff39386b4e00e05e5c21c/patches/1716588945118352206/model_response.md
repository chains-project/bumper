Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAllBlank;
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new one that imports the `isAllBlank` method from the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` class. This method is functionally equivalent to the one in the failed import, but is part of a different package that should be available in the new version.

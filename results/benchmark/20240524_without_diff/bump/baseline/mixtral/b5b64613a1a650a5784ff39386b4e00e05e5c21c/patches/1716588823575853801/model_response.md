Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;

// ...

@Override
public boolean isBlank(String string) {
    return StringUtils.isAllBlank(string);
}
```

This patch imports the `StringUtils` class directly, instead of using a static import. It also defines a method `isBlank` that delegates to the `isAllBlank` method of `StringUtils`. This method has the same signature as the method that was originally annotated with `@Override`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `isAllBlank` method is still available in the version of `commons-lang3` that the client code is using. If this method has been removed, then this patch will not work.

Also note that this patch assumes that the original method was intended to override a method in a superclass or implemented interface. If this was not the case, then the `@Override` annotation should be removed.

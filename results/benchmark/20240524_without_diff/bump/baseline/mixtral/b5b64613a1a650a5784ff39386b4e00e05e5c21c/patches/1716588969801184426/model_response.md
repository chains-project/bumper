Here's a possible patch for the failing code. Since the error message indicates that the `org.apache.commons.text` package does not exist, it seems that the required dependency is missing. You can try adding the following import statement instead:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAllBlank;
```
This imports the `isAllBlank` method from the `org.apache.commons.lang3` package, which provides similar functionality to the `org.apache.commons.text` package. Note that the package name has changed from `text` to `lang3`.

The `org.apache.commons.text` package was introduced in version 3.5 of the Apache Commons Lang library, while the `org.apache.commons.lang3` package has been available since version 3.0. Therefore, if your project is using an older version of the library, you may need to update it to a newer version that includes the `org.apache.commons.text` package.

If updating the library version is not an option, you can use the `org.apache.commons.lang3` package as a replacement. However, note that there may be some differences in the behavior of the `isAllBlank` method between the two packages, so you should test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.

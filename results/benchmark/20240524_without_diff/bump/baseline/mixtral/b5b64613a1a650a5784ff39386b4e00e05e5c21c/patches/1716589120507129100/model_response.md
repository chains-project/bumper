Here's a possible patch for the given code. I'm assuming that the missing `org.apache.commons.text.StringUtils` class is provided by the `commons-text` artifact.

Based on the error message, it seems that the correct artifact version is not being used or not present in the project's dependencies.

You can fix this issue by adding the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file (if you are using Maven) or `build.gradle` file (if you are using Gradle) and make sure that the version number matches the one that you have in your project.

For Maven, add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-text</artifactId>
  <version>1.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add this dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
```python
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.10.0'
}
```

After adding the correct dependency, you can replace the failing line of code with the following:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isAllBlank;
```

This line imports the `isAllBlank` method from the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` class, which provides similar functionality to the `org.apache.commons.text.StringUtils` class.

Note that if you need to use the `org.apache.commons.text` package for other methods, you may need to add the correct version of the `commons-text` artifact to your project's dependencies.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The error message indicates that `Date` cannot be converted to `Timestamp`. However, the given code already converts the `Date` to a `long` using `getTime()` and then converts it back to a `Timestamp`.

Therefore, the error might be caused by an external dependency, and there's no need to change the client code. The error might be resolved by updating or fixing the external dependency.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The issue with the original code is that it's trying to return a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, but the `super.between(from, to)` method returns a `java.util.Date` object.

To fix this, we can simply create a new `Timestamp` object by calling the `getTime()` method on the `Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)`.

Note that this assumes that the `super.between(from, to)` method returns a `Date` object that represents the same timestamp value as the desired `Timestamp` object. If this is not the case, then the code may need to be adjusted accordingly.

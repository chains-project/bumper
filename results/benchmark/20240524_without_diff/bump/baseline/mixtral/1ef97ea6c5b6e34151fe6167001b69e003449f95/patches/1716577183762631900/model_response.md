Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

This code is already correct, so no changes are needed. However, based on the error message, it seems that the external dependency has been updated and now returns a `java.util.Date` object instead of a `java.sql.Timestamp` object.

To fix this issue, you can modify the code as follows:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(from.getTime());
  }
```

This code creates a new `Timestamp` object by getting the time in milliseconds from the `from` `Date` object. This assumes that the `from` and `to` `Date` objects are always non-null. If they can be null, you can add null checks before creating the `Timestamp` object.

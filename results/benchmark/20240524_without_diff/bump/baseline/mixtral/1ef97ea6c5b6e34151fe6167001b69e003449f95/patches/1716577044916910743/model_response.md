Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The proposed patch for the failing method is as follows:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

However, based on the error message, it seems that the issue is not with the client code itself but with the external dependency. Specifically, the error message suggests that the `super.between(from, to)` method returns a `java.util.Date` object, but the method signature requires a `java.sql.Timestamp` object.

One possible solution is to convert the `java.util.Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a `java.sql.Timestamp` object before returning it. Here's an updated version of the method that implements this solution:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.util.Date date = super.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
  }
```

This updated version of the method first assigns the `java.util.Date` object returned by `super.between(from, to)` to a local variable `date`. It then creates a new `java.sql.Timestamp` object by calling the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor with the `getTime()` value of `date`. This ensures that the method returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object as required by the method signature.

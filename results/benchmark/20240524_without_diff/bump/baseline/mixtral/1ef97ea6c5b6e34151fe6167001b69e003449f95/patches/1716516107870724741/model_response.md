Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(from.getTime() - to.getTime());
}
```

The change in the library version removed the original `between` method that returned a `Date` object and added a new `between` method that returns a `Timestamp` object. To fix the error, we need to convert the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before returning. In this patch, we subtract the `to` date from the `from` date to get the difference in milliseconds, and then create a new `Timestamp` object using that value.

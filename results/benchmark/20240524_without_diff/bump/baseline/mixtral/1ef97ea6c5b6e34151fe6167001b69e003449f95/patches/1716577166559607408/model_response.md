Here's the proposed patch:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The issue is not caused by an external dependency, but rather by an incorrect return type. The method should return a `java.sql.Timestamp`, but it's currently returning a `java.util.Date`.

To fix this, we can simply create a new `Timestamp` object by calling the `getTime()` method on the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between()` method.

However, the code you provided is already doing this, so it should not be causing the error message you mentioned.

Therefore, I suspect that the error may be caused by a mismatch between the method signature in the subclass and the overridden method in the superclass.

Please double-check that the superclass's `between()` method returns a `Date` object, and that the superclass has a `getTime()` method that returns a `long`. If not, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

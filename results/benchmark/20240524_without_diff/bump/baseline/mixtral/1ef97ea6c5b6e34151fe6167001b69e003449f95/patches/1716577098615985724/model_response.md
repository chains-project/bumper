Here's the proposed patch:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The issue here is not with the code itself, but with the error message. The error message suggests that `java.util.Date` cannot be converted to `java.sql.Timestamp`, but this is actually not the case. The code itself is correct and should work as expected.

Therefore, no changes are needed in the code itself. The error message is likely misleading and should be investigated further.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

The error message indicates that the issue is caused by an incompatible type conversion between `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp`. To resolve this issue, we can simply create a new `Timestamp` object by calling the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor and passing the time value from the `Date` object.

Here's the updated code:

```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(from.getTime());
  }
```

This updated code creates a new `Timestamp` object by calling the `getTime()` method on the `from` parameter, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. This value can be used to create a new `Timestamp` object without any incompatible type conversion issues.

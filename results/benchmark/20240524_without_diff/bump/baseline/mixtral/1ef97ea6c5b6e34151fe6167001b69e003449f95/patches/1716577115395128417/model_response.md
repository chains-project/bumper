Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    long time = super.between(from, to).getTime();
    return new Timestamp(time);
}
```

This patch creates a new variable `time` to store the time in milliseconds returned by the `getTime()` method of the `Date` object returned by the superclass's `between()` method. Then, it creates a new `Timestamp` object using the `time` variable.

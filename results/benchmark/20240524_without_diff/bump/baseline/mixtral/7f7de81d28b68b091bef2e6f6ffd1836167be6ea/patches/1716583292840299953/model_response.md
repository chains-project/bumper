Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<ManagedObject>> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<ManagedObject>>) server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, (ManagedObject<ManagedObject>) group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

Here, I have added a cast to the `reg` variable and the `group` argument of the `put` method. This is because the error message suggests that the `SortedMap` has a different type parameter than the one expected by the code.

I have also added a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` clause, because the cast may throw this exception if the actual type of the `SortedMap` is not compatible with the expected type.

I have not added any new variables or removed any existing ones, because this is not necessary to fix the error.

I have not removed the `@Override` decorator, because the method is still overriding a method in the new version.

I have not used any removed library methods or added any new ones, because this is not necessary to fix the error.

I have changed the code by adding the casts, which are necessary to make the code compile and run without errors.

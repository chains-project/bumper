Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) registry.get(server);
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The patch fixes the error by adding a cast to the `SortedMap` returned by the `registry` field. This is necessary because the `registry` field has a raw type, which can cause unchecked warnings and compatibility issues. By casting the `SortedMap` to a parameterized type, we ensure that the correct type is used and avoid the compilation error.

Note that the patch also adds a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, to handle the case where the cast fails. This is necessary because the `registry` field has a raw type, so it is possible that the `SortedMap` returned by it has a different type parameter than the one expected by the code. In this case, the cast will fail and a `ClassCastException` will be thrown. By catching this exception, we can handle the failure gracefully and avoid crashing the application.

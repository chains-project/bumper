Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class SimpleThriftLogger {
    // ...

    @Override
    public void log(byte[] data) {
        TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TSocket(host, port));
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I added the import statement for `TTransport` to make sure the class is available. I also changed the type of the `transport` variable to `TTransport` and assigned a new `TFramedTransport` instance to it. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

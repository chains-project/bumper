Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

private TTransport createTransport(String transportType, String host, int port) {
    TTransport transport;
    if (transportType.equalsIgnoreCase("framed")) {
        transport = new TFramedTransport(new TTransport.Client(host, port));
    } else {
        // handle other types of transport if necessary
    }
    return transport;
}
```

In this patch, we added a check for the `transportType` parameter before creating a new `TFramedTransport` object. This ensures that the code will still work even if the `TFramedTransport` constructor is no longer available in the updated version of the external dependency.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TTransport.Client` class is still available in the updated version of the external dependency. If this class is also removed, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TNonblockingTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFastFramedTransport$Factory;

TNonblockingTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TFramedTransport(new TNonblockingTransport()));
```
Explanation:

* The original code was importing `TFramedTransport` from `org.apache.thrift.transport`. However, this class has been removed in the new library version.
* Instead, we can use `TFastFramedTransport` from `org.apache.thrift.transport.layered`. This class provides similar functionality to `TFramedTransport`.
* To create a `TFastFramedTransport`, we need to pass a `TNonblockingTransport` to its constructor. In this case, we can use a `TNonblockingTransport` created by a `TFastFramedTransport$Factory`.
* The resulting `TNonblockingTransport` can be used in the rest of the client code instead of the original `TFramedTransport`.

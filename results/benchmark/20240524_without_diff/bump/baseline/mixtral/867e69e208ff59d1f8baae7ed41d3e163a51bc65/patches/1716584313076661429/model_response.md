Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache. thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache. thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
  // ...
  @Override
  public void open() {
    Transport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TTransport());
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

This patch imports the `TTransport` class, which is a superclass of `TFramedTransport`. This allows us to create an instance of `TFramedTransport` by passing a `TTransport` instance to its constructor. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that the `TFramedTransport` constructor that takes no arguments has been removed in the new version of the library, so we cannot use it. However, the constructor that takes a `TTransport` instance is still available.

Also note that the `TFramedTransport` class has been moved to the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package in the new version of the library. This is why we need to import it using its fully qualified name.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// ...

private TTransport createTransport(String host, int port) {
  TFramedTransport transport = new TFramedTransport();
  transport.open();
  return transport;
}
```
In this patch, I have changed the import statement to use the `TTransport` interface instead of the `TFramedTransport` class. This is because the `TFramedTransport` class may have been removed in the new version of the external dependency.

I have also changed the return type of the `createTransport` method from `TFramedTransport` to `TTransport` to match the new return type.

Finally, I have created a new `TFramedTransport` object and opened it before returning it. This is because the `TFramedTransport` class may require to be opened before it can be used.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TFramedTransport` class is still available in the new version of the external dependency, but it may not be necessary to use it directly. Instead, it may be possible to use the `TTransport` interface and let the external dependency handle the framing of the messages.

Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// Change the type of the transport parameter from TFramedTransport to TTransport
@Override
public void start(TTransport transport) {
  if (transport == null) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Transport cannot be null");
  }
  this.transport = transport;
  this.transport.open();
}
```

This patch removes the dependency on the `TFramedTransport` class and replaces it with the more general `TTransport` class. This should allow the code to compile and run even if `TFramedTransport` is no longer available. Note that this may affect the behavior of the logger if the framing of messages is important for the application.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

// ...

public TTransport createTransport() throws TTransportException {
  TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new THttpClient(host, port));
  transport.open();
  return transport;
}
```

In this patch, I've added an import statement for `TFramedTransport` to make it available for use in the `createTransport` method. I've also added a variable `transport` of type `TTransport` to store the initialized transport object. The `transport` object is then returned at the end of the method.

Note that the `THttpClient` constructor takes a `host` and `port` as arguments, which are not defined in this code snippet. You'll need to define these variables in the enclosing class or pass them as arguments to the `createTransport` method.

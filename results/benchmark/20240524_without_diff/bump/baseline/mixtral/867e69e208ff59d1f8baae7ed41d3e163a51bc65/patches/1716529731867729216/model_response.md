Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory;

public class YourClass {
  // ...

  private TFramedTransport getFramedTransport(TTransport transport) {
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport);
    return framedTransport;
  }

  // ...
}
```
In the above patch, I added a new method `getFramedTransport` that creates a new instance of `TFramedTransport` using the `TTransport` instance passed as an argument. This way, you can avoid directly importing the removed `TFramedTransport$Factory` class.

Note that I had to add an import statement for `TTransport` and `TTransportFactory` to make the code compile. However, I did not modify any existing method signatures or remove the `@Override` decorator. Additionally, I did not use any removed library methods.

Please replace the implementation of the method that's causing the compilation error with the above code.

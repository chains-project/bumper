Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

// Use a different type of transport that is still supported
private TTransport createTransport() {
  return new org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket(host, port);
}
```
In this patch, we have replaced the use of `TFramedTransport` with `TSocket`, which is still supported in the version of the Thrift library that the client is using. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error that was occurring.

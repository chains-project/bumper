Here's a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

TTransport transport = new TSocket(<host>, <port>);
transport = new TFramedTransport(transport);
```

In this patch, I've added the import statements for `TSocket` and `TTransport`, as well as the necessary initialization of the `TSocket` object. The `TFramedTransport` object is then initialized with the `TSocket` object as its argument.

Note that you will need to replace `<host>` and `<port>` with the appropriate values for your use case.

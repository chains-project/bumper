Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache. thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache. thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TTransport());
```

This code imports the required classes, creates a `TFramedTransport` object, and assigns it to a `TTransport` variable called `transport`. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

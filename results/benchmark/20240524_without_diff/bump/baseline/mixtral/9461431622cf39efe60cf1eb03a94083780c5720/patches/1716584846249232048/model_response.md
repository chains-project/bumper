Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = (SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>) registry.get(server);
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The change I made is to add a cast when getting the `registry` value from the `server` object. This is necessary because the `registry` field is defined as a `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>`, but the code is trying to assign it to a variable of type `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`. The cast ensures that the correct type is used.

I also added a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, because the cast may throw this exception if the types are not compatible.

Note that this patch assumes that the `server` object is an instance of a class that has a `registry` field of the correct type. If this is not the case, then the code may still fail at runtime.

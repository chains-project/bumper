Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        Map<MOScope, ? extends ManagedObject> unmodifiableReg = Collections.unmodifiableMap(reg);
        registry.set(server, unmodifiableReg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The main change I made is to declare the `reg` variable as `Map<MOScope, ManagedObject>` instead of `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`. This is because the `put` method of the `SortedMap` interface returns `void`, whereas the `put` method of the `Map` interface returns the previous value associated with the key, or `null` if there was no such key. The `registry` field is declared as a `Map` in the library, so it is safer to use the `Map` interface when interacting with it.

I also added a line to create an unmodifiable view of the `reg` map and passed it to the `registry` field. This is because the `registry` field is declared as a `Map` with a wildcard type, and the compiler cannot guarantee that the `reg` map is assignable to this type. By creating an unmodifiable view of the `reg` map, we can ensure that it will not be modified in a way that would violate the type constraints of the `registry` field.

Note that these changes should not affect the behavior of the `registerHard` method, as long as the `registry` field is still a `Map` in the library. If the `registry` field has been changed to a `SortedMap` in the library, then additional changes may be necessary.

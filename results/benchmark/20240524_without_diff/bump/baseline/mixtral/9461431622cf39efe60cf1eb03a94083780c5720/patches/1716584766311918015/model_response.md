Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        TypeToken<SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>> typeToken = new TypeToken<SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>>(){};
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>> uncheckedReg = new HashMap<>();
        uncheckedReg.putAll(reg);
        registry.set(server, uncheckedReg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The patch creates a new `HashMap` called `uncheckedReg` that has the same key-value mappings as `reg`, but is of the raw type `Map<MOScope, ManagedObject<?>>`. This allows it to be assigned to the `registry` field without causing a type mismatch error.

Note that this patch uses a raw type, which is generally not recommended because it can lead to unchecked warnings and other issues. However, in this case, it is a simple way to fix the type mismatch error without changing the external dependency.

It's also worth noting that this patch only works if the `registry` field is not used in a way that depends on its generic type. If the `registry` field is used in a way that requires its generic type to be known, then a different approach may be needed.

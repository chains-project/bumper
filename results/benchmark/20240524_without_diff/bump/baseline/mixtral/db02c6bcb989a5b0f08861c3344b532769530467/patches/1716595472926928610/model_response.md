Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the issue:
```java
@Override
public void describeTo(io.cucumber.core.backend.TestDescription description) {
    description.append("a string containing ").append(substring);
}
```
In this version, I have changed the type of the `description` parameter to `io.cucumber.core.backend.TestDescription` which is the new type of the `Description` interface in the latest version of Cucumber-JVM. Additionally, I have replaced the `appendText` method with the `append` method, which is the new name of the method in the latest version of Cucumber-JVM.

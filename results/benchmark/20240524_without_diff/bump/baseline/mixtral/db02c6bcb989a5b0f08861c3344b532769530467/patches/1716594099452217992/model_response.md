Here's a fixed version of the method that removes the `@Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version:

```java
public boolean matches(Object actual) {
    return actual instanceof String && ((String) actual).contains(expected);
}
```
Note that this assumes that the error is caused by a missing or incorrectly implemented method in the supertype, rather than a change in the behavior of a library method. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the method to use a different library method or approach.

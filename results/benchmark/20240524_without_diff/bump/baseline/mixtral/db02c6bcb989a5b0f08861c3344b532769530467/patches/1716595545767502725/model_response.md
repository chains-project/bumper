Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the fixed version of the method:
```java
  @Override
  public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
    org.hamcrest.Description hamcrestDescription = (org.hamcrest.Description) description;
    hamcrestDescription.appendText("was ").appendValue(s);
  }
```
The issue is that the `Description` class used in the method signature is not the same as the one in the superclass, which causes the error. By casting the `description` parameter to the correct `Description` class, the issue is resolved.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(org.hamcrest.Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
    }
```
The failure might be caused by a change in the `Description` type, which could be imported from a different package. To fix the issue, I have explicitly specified the fully-qualified name of the `Description` class from the `org.hamcrest` package. This ensures that the correct version of the class is used.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` annotation because the method is still overriding a method from the supertype. Also, I did not create any new variables, as the original code was already clear and concise. Finally, I did not use any removed or added library methods, as they were not necessary to fix the error.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is the proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(s, org.hamcrest.Matchers.notNullValue());
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(description, org.hamcrest.Matchers.notNullValue());
        description.appendText("was ").appendText(s);
    }
```
Explanation:

* I added null checks for the input parameters using Hamcrest library. This ensures that the method is not called with null arguments, which could cause a `NullPointerException`.
* I replaced `appendValue` method with `appendText` method, since `appendValue` method might not be available in the new version of the library.
* I kept the `@Override` annotation, since it ensures that the method is overriding a method in the supertype.
* I did not remove any library methods identified with `--`, since they are not present in the code.
* I did not add any library methods identified with `++`, since they are not required to fix the error.

Note: The actual solution may vary depending on the specific version of the library and the root cause of the error. The above patch is just one possible solution.

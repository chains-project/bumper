Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patched version of the failing method:
```java
@Override
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(String.valueOf(expected));
}
```
The change I made is to replace `appendValue` with `appendText` and convert the `expected` value to a string using `String.valueOf()`. This is because the `appendValue` method is no longer available in the updated version of the library, and has been replaced with `appendText`. The `appendText` method takes a `CharSequence` as an argument, which can be a string or a character array. By converting `expected` to a string using `String.valueOf()`, we ensure that it can be passed as a `CharSequence` to `appendText`.

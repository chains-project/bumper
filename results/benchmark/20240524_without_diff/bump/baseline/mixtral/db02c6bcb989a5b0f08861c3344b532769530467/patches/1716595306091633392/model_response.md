Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
    public boolean matches(String s) {
        if (substring == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("substring cannot be null");
        }
        return s.contains(substring);
    }
```
The error message suggests that the method is not actually overriding any method in the supertype. This could be because the `substring` field is no longer present in the supertype. To fix this, I added a null check for `substring` before using it. This ensures that the method still behaves the same way as before, but it no longer depends on the presence of the `substring` field in the supertype.

Note that this patch assumes that the `substring` field is declared as a class variable. If it is actually a method parameter, then the error message suggests that the method signature has changed in the new version, in which case you would need to update the method signature to match the new version.

Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
        org.hamcrest.Description hamcrestDescription = (org.hamcrest.Description) description;
        hamcrestDescription.appendText("was ").appendValue(s);
    }
```
In this patch, we're casting the `Description` parameter to `org.hamcrest.Description`, which is the actual type of the object that the method is supposed to override. This should resolve the error message you're seeing.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Description` parameter being passed to the method is actually an instance of `org.hamcrest.Description`. If this is not the case, then this patch may not work as expected. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems likely that this is the correct type for the parameter.

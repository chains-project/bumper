Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, new StringStartsWith.MatchesEnd(startsWith))
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The changes made are:

* A boolean variable `startsWith` is introduced to store the result of the check for the presence of the substring `"/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"` in the string `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER`.
* The `StringStartsWith` constructor is called with two arguments: `Matcher.ANY_STRING` and a new instance of `StringStartsWith.MatchesEnd` initialized with the value of `startsWith`.

Note that the `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` and `Matcher.ANY_STRING` constants are introduced in the new version of the library.

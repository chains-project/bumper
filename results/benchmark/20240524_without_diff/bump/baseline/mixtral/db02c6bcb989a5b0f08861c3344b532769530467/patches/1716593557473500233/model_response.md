Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(Object actual) {
    if (actual instanceof String) {
        String actualStr = (String) actual;
        return actualStr.contains(expected);
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this patch, I added a null check for the `actual` parameter before casting it to a `String`. This ensures that the code won't throw a `ClassCastException` if `actual` is null or not an instance of `String`. I also extracted the casted `actual` value to a separate variable for better readability.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` annotation, as it is good practice to include it to ensure that the method is actually overriding a method from a supertype. However, if the method is not overriding any method in the new version, you can safely remove it.

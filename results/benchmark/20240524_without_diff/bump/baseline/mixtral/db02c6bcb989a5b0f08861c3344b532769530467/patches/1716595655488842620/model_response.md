Sure, here's a possible patch for the code:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
        org.hamcrest.Description desc = (Description) description;
        desc.appendText("was ").appendValue(s);
    }
```
It turns out that the `Description` class has been refactored in the new version of the library, and the original method signature is no longer valid. To fix the issue, we need to cast the `description` parameter to its original type, `org.hamcrest.Description`, before using it.

Note that this patch assumes that the original `Description` class was from the `org.hamcrest` package. If it's from a different package, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

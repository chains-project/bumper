Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a patched version of the failing method:
```java
    @Override
    public void describeTo(org.hamcrest.Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
    }
```
In this patch, I added the fully-qualified name of the `Description` type, since it's possible that the type was imported from a different package in the new version of the dependency. This should resolve the error message you're seeing.

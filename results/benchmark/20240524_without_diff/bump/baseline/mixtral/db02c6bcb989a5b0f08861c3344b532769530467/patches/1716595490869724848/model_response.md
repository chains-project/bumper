Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(io.cucumber.core.backend.TestCase testCase) {
        testCase.appendText("a string containing ").appendValue(substring);
    }
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `describeTo` method is not overriding any method from a supertype. This suggests that the method signature has changed in the new version of the library.

By looking at the error message, we can see that the `Description` class has been replaced by `io.cucumber.core.backend.TestCase`. Therefore, we need to change the parameter type of the `describeTo` method to `io.cucumber.core.backend.TestCase`.

Additionally, we need to change the method call from `description.appendText` to `testCase.appendText` and from `description.appendValue` to `testCase.appendValue` to match the new method signature.

Sure, I can help with that. Based on the error message, it seems that the method `describeTo` is not overriding any method from a supertype. To fix this issue, you can remove the `@Override` annotation from the method. Here's the updated code:
```java
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
}
```
This should resolve the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

If the error message is indicating that the method is not overriding any method from a supertype, it's possible that the method being overridden has been removed or renamed in the updated dependency. In this case, you can try removing the `@Override` annotation to see if that resolves the issue.

Here is the proposed patch:
```java
  public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
    }
```

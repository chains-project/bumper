Sure, here's a patch that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(s, org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.notNullValue());
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(description, org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.notNullValue());
        description.appendText("was ").appendText(s);
    }
```
Explanation:

* I added null checks for the input arguments, as it's possible that the external dependency update changed the behavior of these arguments.
* I replaced the `appendValue` method with `appendText`, as the former might have been removed in the updated dependency.

Note: I'm assuming that the `Description` class still has the `appendText` method available in the updated dependency. If not, you might need to adjust the code accordingly.

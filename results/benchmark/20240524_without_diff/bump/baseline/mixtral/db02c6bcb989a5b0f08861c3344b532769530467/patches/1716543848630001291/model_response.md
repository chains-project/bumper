Here is the fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In the original code, the `StringStartsWith` constructor was being passed two arguments, but it only expects one argument. I have created a new variable `startsWith` and set it to `false`, and then passed this variable as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This should fix the error.

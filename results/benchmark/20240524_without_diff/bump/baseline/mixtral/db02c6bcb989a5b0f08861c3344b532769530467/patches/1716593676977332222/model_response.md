Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(String.valueOf(expected));
    }
```
The failure might be caused by a change in the `Description` class, where the `appendValue` method is no longer available. To fix this, we can replace the `appendValue` method with `appendText`, and convert the `expected` value to a string using `String.valueOf` method. This ensures that the `appendText` method receives a string value, which is expected.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Description` class still has the `appendText` method available. If that's not the case, you might need to look for other alternatives to append the text to the description.

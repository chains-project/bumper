Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing ").appendText(substring);
    }
```
The failure is caused by the use of `appendValue` method, which is not present in the `Description` class. Instead, we can use the `appendText` method to concatenate the string and the `substring` variable. This should fix the error.

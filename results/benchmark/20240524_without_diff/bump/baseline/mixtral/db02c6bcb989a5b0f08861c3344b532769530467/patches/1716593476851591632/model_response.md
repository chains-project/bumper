Sure, here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
    @Override
    public boolean specificMatches(Object actual) {
        if (actual instanceof String) {
            String str = (String) actual;
            return str.contains(expected);
        }
        return false;
    }
```
In this patched version, I've renamed the method to `specificMatches` to avoid the issue of it not overriding any method in the supertype. I've also added a null check for the `actual` parameter and added a local variable `str` to make the code cleaner.

Note that this patch assumes that the `expected` variable is defined and initialized in the enclosing scope. If that's not the case, you'll need to modify the patch accordingly.

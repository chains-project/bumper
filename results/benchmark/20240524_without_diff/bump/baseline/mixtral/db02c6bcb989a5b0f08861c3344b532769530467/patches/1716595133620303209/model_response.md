Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(String s) {
    if (substring == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("substring is null");
    }
    return s.contains(substring);
}
```

This patch checks if `substring` is `null` before calling `s.contains(substring)`. This is because the error message suggests that `substring` might be `null` in the new version of the external dependency. By checking for `null` and throwing an exception, we can ensure that the method behaves consistently even if `substring` is `null`.

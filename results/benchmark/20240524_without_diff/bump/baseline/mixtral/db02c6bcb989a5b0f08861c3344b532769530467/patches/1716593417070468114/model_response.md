Sure, I understand the constraints. Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public boolean specificMatches(Object actual) {
        if (actual instanceof String) {
            String actualString = (String) actual;
            return actualString.contains(expected);
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Explanation:
I created a new method named `specificMatches` that overrides the original `matches` method. The reason for this is that the `matches` method may have been removed from the external dependency, causing the original method to fail. By creating a new method with a different name, we can avoid this issue.
The new method checks if the `actual` parameter is an instance of `String`. If it is, it casts it to a `String` and checks if it contains the `expected` value. If it is not a `String`, the method returns `false`.
Note that I removed the `contains` method call from the original `matches` method and moved it inside the new `specificMatches` method. This is because the `contains` method may have been removed from the external dependency, causing the original method to fail. By moving it inside the new method, we can avoid this issue.
I also added a check for the `actual` parameter being an instance of `String` before casting it. This is because the external dependency may have changed the type of the `actual` parameter, causing a `ClassCastException` when casting it to a `String`. By adding this check, we can avoid this issue.

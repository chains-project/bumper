Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the failing method:
```java
@Override
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(String.valueOf(expected));
}
```
The change I made is to replace `appendValue` with `appendText` and convert the `expected` value to a string using `String.valueOf`. This should fix the error you were seeing.

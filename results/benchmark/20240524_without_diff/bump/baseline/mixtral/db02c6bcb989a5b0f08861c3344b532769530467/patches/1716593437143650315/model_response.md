Here's a possible patch for the given code:
```java
  @Override
    public boolean doMatch(Object actual) {
        return actual instanceof String && ((String) actual).contains(expected);
    }
```
Explanation:
- I created a new method name `doMatch` to avoid the error message, since the original method name `matches` is not present in the supertype.
- I kept the method signature the same, except for the name change.
- I did not remove the `@Override` annotation, since it is not causing the error and it can help catch errors in the future.
- I did not create any new variables, since they are not necessary to solve the error.
- I did not change any library methods or create any new ones.
- I only changed the method name to a new name that is not present in the supertype.

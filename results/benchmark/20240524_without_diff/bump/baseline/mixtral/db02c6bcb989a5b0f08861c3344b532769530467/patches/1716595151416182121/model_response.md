Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
  @Override
  public boolean matches(String s) {
    return s.contains(substring);
  }
```

This code is identical to the original, which suggests that the issue may not be with the client code itself. Instead, it's possible that the supertype that this method is intended to override or implement has been removed or changed in a way that makes the method no longer compatible.

In this case, you may need to investigate the supertype and its dependencies to determine the root cause of the issue. However, without more information about the supertype and its dependencies, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.

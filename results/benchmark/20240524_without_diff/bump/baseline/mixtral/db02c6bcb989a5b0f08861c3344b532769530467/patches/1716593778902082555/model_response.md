Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionOnInvalidPath() {
    IllegalArgumentException e = Assertions.assertThrows(
        IllegalArgumentException.class,
        () -> new UploadEntity.Request(
            new RequestLine(RqMethod.PUT, "/one/two").toString()
        ).name()
    );
    Assertions.assertTrue(e.getMessage().contains("Unexpected path"), "Unexpected path not found in error message");
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` call with an `Assertions.assertThrows` call to get a reference to the exception that's being thrown. I then checked that the exception message contains the string "Unexpected path" using `Assertions.assertTrue` and `String.contains`.

Note that this patch assumes that the error message of the `IllegalArgumentException` thrown by the `UploadEntity.Request` constructor contains the string "Unexpected path" when the path is invalid. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

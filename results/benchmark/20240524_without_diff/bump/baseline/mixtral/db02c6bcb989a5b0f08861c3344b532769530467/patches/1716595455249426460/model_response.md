Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing ").appendText(substring.toString());
    }
```
The failure might be caused by a change in the `appendValue` method of the `Description` class. To be safe, we can replace the `appendValue` method with `appendText` and convert the `substring` variable to a string using the `toString` method. This should ensure compatibility with both the old and new versions of the external dependency.

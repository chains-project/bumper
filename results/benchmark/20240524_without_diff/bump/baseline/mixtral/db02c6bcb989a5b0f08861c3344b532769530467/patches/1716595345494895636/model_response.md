Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing ").appendText(substring.toString());
}
```

In this patch, I changed the second `appendValue` call to `appendText` and converted the `substring` variable to a string by calling `toString()` on it. The `appendValue` method is no longer available in the Hamcrest library, which might be causing the error. By using `appendText` instead, we can avoid the error and still achieve the same functionality.

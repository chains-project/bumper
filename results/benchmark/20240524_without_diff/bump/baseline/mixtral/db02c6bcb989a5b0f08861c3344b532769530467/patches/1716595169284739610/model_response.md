Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public boolean matches(String s) {
        if (substring == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("substring cannot be null");
        }
        return s.contains(substring);
    }
```
This patch checks if `substring` is `null` before using it, which should prevent the error message from appearing. It also adds a helpful error message in case `substring` is `null`.

Note: This patch assumes that `substring` is a field in the class that contains the `matches` method. If `substring` is a parameter of the method, then the patch would not be necessary.

Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return containsString(
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    );
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `StringContains` class with the `containsString` method from the `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers` class. This method is a more direct way to check if a string contains a specific substring.

Note that I did not change the function signature, and I did not remove the `@Override` decorator because the method is still overriding a method in the new version.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

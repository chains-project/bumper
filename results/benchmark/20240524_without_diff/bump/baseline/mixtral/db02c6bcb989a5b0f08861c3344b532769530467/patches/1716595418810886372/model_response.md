Sure, based on the given error message, it seems that the method `describeTo(Description description)` is not overriding any method from a supertype. To fix this issue, you can simply remove the `@Override` annotation from the method. Here is the fixed method:
```java
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing ").appendValue(substring);
}
```
Note that I did not add or remove any code other than the `@Override` annotation, as you requested.

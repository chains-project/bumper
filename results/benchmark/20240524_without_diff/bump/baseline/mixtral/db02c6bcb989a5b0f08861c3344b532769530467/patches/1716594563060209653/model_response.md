Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(io.cucumber.core.api.ScenarioDescription description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
    }
```
In this patched version, I replaced the `Description` type with `io.cucumber.core.api.ScenarioDescription`. This is because the `Description` type is no longer available in the external dependency, and has been replaced with `io.cucumber.core.api.ScenarioDescription` in the new version. By changing the type of the `description` parameter, the method can now correctly override the method from the supertype.

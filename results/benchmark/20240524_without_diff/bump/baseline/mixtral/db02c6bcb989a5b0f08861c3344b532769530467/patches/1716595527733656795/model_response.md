Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
        org.hamcrest.Description desc = (org.hamcrest.Description) description;
        desc.appendText("was ").appendValue(s);
    }
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `describeMismatch` method is not overriding any method from a supertype. This suggests that there may be a mismatch between the method signature in the supertype and the one in the subtype.

Looking at the code, it seems that the `Description` parameter is not the expected type. The method is supposed to override `MatcherAssert.describeMismatch`, which takes an `org.hamcrest.Description` parameter. However, the `Description` parameter in the method signature is of type `org.junit.internal.Description`.

To fix this, we can cast the `description` parameter to the expected type `org.hamcrest.Description` and assign it to a new variable `desc`. We can then use `desc` instead of `description` in the method body.

Note: I assumed that the `Description` class in the `junit.internal` package is not a part of the external dependency that was updated, as it is not marked with `++` or `--`. If this is not the case, please let me know and I will adjust the patch accordingly.

Here's the fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The only change here is the introduction of a new variable `startsWith`, which is assigned the value `false`. This value is then passed as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This is necessary because the `StringStartsWith` constructor now requires exactly one argument, instead of the two it previously accepted.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(io.cucumber.core.api.ScenarioDescriptor scenario) {
        scenario.write("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
    }
```
In this patch, I replaced the `Description` parameter with `ScenarioDescriptor`, which is the new parameter type for the `describeTo` method in the updated version of the library. I also replaced the `appendText` method with `write` method, which is the new method for appending text to the description.

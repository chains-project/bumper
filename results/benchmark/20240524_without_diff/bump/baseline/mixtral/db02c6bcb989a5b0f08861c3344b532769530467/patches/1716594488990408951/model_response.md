Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(io.cucumber.core.api.ScenarioDescriptor scenario) {
        scenario.write("a string containing: ").appendValue(expected);
    }
```
In this patch, I replaced the `Description` parameter with `ScenarioDescriptor` and changed the method to write to the scenario description instead of appending text to it. This should resolve the error message about the method not overriding or implementing a method from a supertype.

Note that this patch assumes that the `expected` variable is still in scope and contains the value that needs to be appended to the scenario description. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(String.valueOf(expected));
    }
```
In this patch, I replaced the `appendValue` method with `appendText`, and converted the `expected` value to a string using `String.valueOf` method. This is because the `appendValue` method might have been removed from the external library, causing the failure. By using `appendText` instead, we can ensure that the method still works as intended.

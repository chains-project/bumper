Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public boolean matches(String s) {
        if (substring == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("substring cannot be null");
        }
        return s.contains(substring);
    }
```
The change here is the addition of a null check for the `substring` variable. It's possible that the superclass method being overridden has been changed to require that `substring` is non-null. By adding this check, we ensure that the method still compiles and runs correctly, even if `substring` is not initialized.

Note that this patch assumes that `substring` is a class-level variable. If it's a method-level variable, then the null check may not be necessary. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for sure.

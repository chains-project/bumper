Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(String.valueOf(expected));
    }
```
The failure is caused by the fact that the `appendValue` method was removed from the `Description` class, so I replaced it with `appendText` and converted the `expected` value to a string using `String.valueOf`. This should fix the error.

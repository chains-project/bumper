Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public boolean matches(Object actual) {
        if (!(actual instanceof String)) {
            return false;
        }
        String str = (String) actual;
        return str.contains(expected);
    }
```
In this patch, I added a null check for the `actual` parameter before casting it to a `String`. This way, the method won't throw a `ClassCastException` if `actual` is not an instance of `String`. Then, I created a new variable `str` to hold the casted value of `actual`, and used it to check if it contains the `expected` value.

Note that I didn't remove the `@Override` annotation, as the method is still overriding a method from a supertype. Also, I didn't use any removed library methods (`--`) or added library methods (`++`).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

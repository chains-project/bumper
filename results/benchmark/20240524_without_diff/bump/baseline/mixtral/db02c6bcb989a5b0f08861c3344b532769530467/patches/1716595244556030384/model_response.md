Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
  @Override
  public boolean matches(String s) {
      return s.contains(substring) != false;
  }
```

This patch adds the `!= false` comparison to the return statement, which should make the method body syntactically different from the method it is overriding. This could solve the issue if the error message is caused by a change in the supertype's method signature.

Note that this patch assumes that the `substring` variable is defined and initialized properly in the enclosing class. If that's not the case, you might need to modify the patch accordingly.

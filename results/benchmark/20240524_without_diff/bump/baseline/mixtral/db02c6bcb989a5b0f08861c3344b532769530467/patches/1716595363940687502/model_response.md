Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing ").appendText(String.valueOf(substring));
}
```

I added a call to `String.valueOf()` to convert the `substring` value to a string before appending it to the `description`. This should resolve the error message you received.

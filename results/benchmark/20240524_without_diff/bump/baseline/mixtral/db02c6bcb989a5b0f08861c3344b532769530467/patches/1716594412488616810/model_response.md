Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(Objects.toString(expected));
    }
```
I added a call to `Objects.toString(expected)` to convert the `expected` value to a string, since the `appendValue` method was causing the compilation error. I also changed the second `appendText` call to use a string literal instead of a variable, since the original code was using `appendValue` which is not a valid method.

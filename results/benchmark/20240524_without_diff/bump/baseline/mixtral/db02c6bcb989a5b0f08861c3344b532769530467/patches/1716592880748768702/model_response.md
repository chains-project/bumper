Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void shouldPull() throws Exception {
    final String image = this.copy(new Image.ForOs());
    this.cli.run("push", image);
    this.cli.run("image", "rm", image);
    String output = this.cli.run("pull", image);
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        output,
        new StringContains("Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image)
    );
}
```

In this patch, I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, as it is not needed and is causing the compilation error. I also added a `+` sign to concatenate the `image` variable with the expected string in the `StringContains` constructor.

Note that I made this change based on the assumption that the `StringContains` constructor expects a `String` argument representing the expected substring. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(String s) {
    return s.contains(substring);
}
```

This code is identical to the original method, which means that the issue is not caused by the method itself. Instead, it's likely that the error is caused by a change in the external dependency. In this case, you may need to update the dependency version or modify the client code to be compatible with the new version.

However, without more information about the external dependency and its version changes, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. Therefore, I'm returning the same code as a placeholder.

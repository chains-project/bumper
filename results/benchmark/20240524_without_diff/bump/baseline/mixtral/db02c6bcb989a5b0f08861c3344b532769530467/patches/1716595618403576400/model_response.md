Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the method that should fix the error:
```java
  @Override
  public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
    MatcherDescription mismatch = new MatcherDescription();
    mismatch.appendText("was ").appendValue(s);
    description.append(mismatch);
  }
```
In this patched version, I created a new `MatcherDescription` object and appended the text and value to it, then appended the `MatcherDescription` object to the `description` object. This should fix the error because it uses the `append` method of the `Description` class instead of the `appendText` method, which is not present in the supertype.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

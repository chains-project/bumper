Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(Object actual) {
    if (actual instanceof String) {
        String actualStr = (String) actual;
        return actualStr.contains(expected);
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this patch, I added a null check for `actual` before casting it to a `String`. I also created a separate variable `actualStr` to hold the result of the cast. This ensures that the cast is only performed once, which can improve performance and make the code easier to read.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` annotation, as the method is still overriding a method in the supertype. I also did not use any removed or added library methods.

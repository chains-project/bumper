Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, we create a new variable `startsWith` that checks if the given string `/v2/test/blobs/uploads/` contains any character (`Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER`). This allows us to use the `StringStartsWith` constructor with the correct number of arguments.

Note that the `StringStartsWith` constructor with two arguments has been removed in the new library version, which is why we need to use the `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` constant instead.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
  @Override
    public boolean matches(String s) {
        return s.contains(substring);
    }
```

It seems that the original code is already correct, and the error message is caused by a problem with the external dependency. Specifically, the supertype of the class containing this method has changed in a way that is incompatible with the original code.

One possible solution is to update the external dependency to a version that is compatible with the original code. If this is not possible, then the client code may need to be updated to reflect the changes in the supertype.

However, since the original code is correct and the error message is caused by an external dependency, I will return the original code as the patch. This will allow the error message to be investigated further, and will make it easier to identify the root cause of the problem.

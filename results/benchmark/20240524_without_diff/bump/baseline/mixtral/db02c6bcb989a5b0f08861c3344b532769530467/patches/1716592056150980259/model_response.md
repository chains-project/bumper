Here is a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Downloaded newer image for"
    );
}
```
In this patch, I added a third argument to the `StringContains` constructor, which specifies a substring that should be present in the target string. This substring is "Downloaded newer image for", which is the beginning of the expected log message.

By doing this, the `StringContains` constructor should now accept the given arguments, and the error message should no longer appear.

Note that the behavior of the method is unchanged, as the `StringContains` constructor still checks if the target string contains the given substring. The only difference is that now the constructor can be called with the given arguments, which was not possible in the original code.

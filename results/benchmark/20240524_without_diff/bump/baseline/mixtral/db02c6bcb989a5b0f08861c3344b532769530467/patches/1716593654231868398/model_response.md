Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeTo(Description description) {
        description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(this.expected);
    }
```
The only change made is to qualify the `expected` variable with `this` keyword, so that the correct instance variable is referred. This should fix the error.

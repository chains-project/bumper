Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
  @Override
  public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
    org.hamcrest.Description desc = description;
    desc.appendText("was ").appendValue(s);
  }
```
In this patch, we create a new variable `desc` of type `org.hamcrest.Description` and assign the `description` argument to it. We then call the `appendText` and `appendValue` methods on `desc` instead of `description`. This is because the `Description` class in the error message (`/docker-adapter/src/test/java/com/artipie/docker/asto/AstoBlobsITCase.java:[117,5]`) is likely not the same as the `Description` class in the original code, and the method signature of `describeMismatch` has not changed.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Description` class in the error message is the same as the `org.hamcrest.Description` class. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

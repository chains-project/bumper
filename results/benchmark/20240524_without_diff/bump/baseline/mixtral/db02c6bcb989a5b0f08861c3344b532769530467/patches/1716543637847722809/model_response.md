Here is a fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The issue is caused by the fact that the `StringStartsWith` constructor expects only one argument, whereas in the original code it is being passed two arguments. To fix this, I have created a new boolean variable `startsWith` and set it to the original value of `false`. This variable is then passed as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This way, the `StringStartsWith` constructor only receives one argument, which is the correct number of arguments for this constructor.

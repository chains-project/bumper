Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a patched version of the failing method that should fix the error:
```java
@Override
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendValue(ObjectUtils.identityToString(expected));
}
```
In this patched version, I added a call to `ObjectUtils.identityToString()` to convert the `expected` object to a string, which should satisfy the `appendValue()` method's requirement that its argument be a `CharSequence`. I also added an import statement for `ObjectUtils` at the top of the file:
```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.ObjectUtils;
```
This assumes that the `ObjectUtils` class is still available in the project's dependencies, even if its `toString()` method is no longer present. If that's not the case, you may need to find a different way to convert `expected` to a string.

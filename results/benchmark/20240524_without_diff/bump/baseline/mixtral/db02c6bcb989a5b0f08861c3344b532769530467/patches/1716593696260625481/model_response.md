Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public void describeTo(Description description) {
    description.appendText("a string containing: ").appendText(Objects.toString(expected));
}
```
In the original code, the `appendValue` method is used to append the `expected` value to the `description`. However, this method is not available in the supertype, causing the error. To fix this, we can use the `appendText` method instead, and convert the `expected` value to a string using `Objects.toString` method.

Note that the `Objects` class is part of the `java.util` package, which is a standard library and should be available in any Java environment.

Sure, here's a possible patch for the code you provided:
```java
  @Override
    public void describeMismatch(String s, Description description) {
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(s, org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.notNullValue());
        org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(description, org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.notNullValue());
        description.appendText("was ").appendText(s);
    }
```
In this patch, I added some null checks for the input parameters `s` and `description` using Hamcrest's `MatcherAssert` and `CoreMatchers`. I also changed the second `appendValue` call to `appendText` since the `appendValue` method was causing the compilation error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Description` class has an `appendText` method that takes a `String` parameter. If that's not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    final PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    beginShape();
    vertex(0, 0);
    vertex(5, 0);
    vertex(5, 5);
    vertex(0, 5);
    endShape(CLOSE);
    mink.setShapeType(PATH);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The patch creates a new `PShape` object using the `createShape` method, which is an added library method identified with `++`. It also sets the shape type of the `mink` object to `PATH` using the `setShapeType` method. This is because the `PShape` constructor used in the original code is deprecated and has been removed in newer versions of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `createShape` and `setShapeType` methods are available in the version of the library that the client code is using. If these methods are not available, a different approach may be necessary.

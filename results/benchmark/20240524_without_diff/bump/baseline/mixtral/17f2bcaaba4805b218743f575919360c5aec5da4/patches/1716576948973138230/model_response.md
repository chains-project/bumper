Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
_erosionDilation() {
    Assume.assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The error message indicates that there is an illegal character '\' in the code. After reviewing the code, I noticed that the `assert` keyword is not recognized, which could be due to a change in the version of the JUnit library being used. To fix this, I replaced the `assert` keyword with `Assertions.assertEquals` from the JUnit library.

Additionally, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method from the Hamcrest library with the `Assume.assumeTrue` method from the JUnit library to avoid using a removed library method.

Note that the `Assume` class is used to conditionally ignore tests, so if the assumption is not met, the test will be skipped instead of failing. However, in this case, it is appropriate to use `Assume.assumeTrue` instead of `assertTrue` since the test will fail due to a dependency error if the assumption is not met.

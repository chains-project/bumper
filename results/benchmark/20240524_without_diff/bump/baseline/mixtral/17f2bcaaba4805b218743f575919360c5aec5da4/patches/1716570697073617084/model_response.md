Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null result.");
    }
}
```

In this patch, I added a null check for the `out` variable to avoid the "cannot find symbol" error, which is likely caused by the `out` variable not being initialized. Additionally, I added an import statement for `PConstants.CLOSE` to avoid any potential issues with static imports.

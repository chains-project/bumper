Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null result from PGS_Morphology.minkSum()");
    }
}
```

The main change I made is to check if the result of `PGS_Morphology.minkSum()` is not null before calling `out.getChildCount()`. This is likely causing the "cannot find symbol" error, as the `out` variable might not be initialized.

Note that I cannot be sure that this is the exact cause of the error without more context, but this change should at least prevent the error from occurring in this specific case.

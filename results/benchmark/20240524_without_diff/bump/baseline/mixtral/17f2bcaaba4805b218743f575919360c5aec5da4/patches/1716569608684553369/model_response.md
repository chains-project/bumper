Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I've changed all occurrences of `PGS_Morphology` to `Morphology`. This is because the `PGS_Morphology` class may have been removed or renamed in the updated dependency, while the `Morphology` class is likely a replacement or a more generic version of the same class.

Additionally, I've assumed that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is a static variable in the `Morphology` class, as it was in the original code. If this is not the case, the code may need to be further modified to correctly reference the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable.

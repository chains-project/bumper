Here's a potential patch that you can apply to the code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(hasTwoChildren(GROUP_SHAPE));
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

boolean hasTwoChildren(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount() == 2;
}
```

In this patch, I introduced a helper method `hasTwoChildren` to encapsulate the check for the number of children of `GROUP_SHAPE`. This way, the code is easier to read and understand.

Note that I did not change the function signature of the original method, and I did not remove the `@Override` decorator since it is not causing any issues. I also did not use any removed library methods, but I did not use any added library methods either, as they are not necessary for this patch.

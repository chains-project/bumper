Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```

This patch replaces the problematic static import with a regular import, and then uses the fully qualified name of the `assumeTrue` method. This should resolve the compilation error. Make sure to replace the comment `/* your condition here */` with the actual condition you want to check.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code. I'm assuming that the issue is caused by a missing or unimported class. I'll import the missing class as `PShape`.

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
	assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
	PShape out = PGS_Morphology.smoothGaussian(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
	assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

If this doesn't work, there might be another issue. In that case, please provide more context or error details, so I can give a more accurate solution.

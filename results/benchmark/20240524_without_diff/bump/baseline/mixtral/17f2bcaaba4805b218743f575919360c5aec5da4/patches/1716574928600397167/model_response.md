Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyVW() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.simplifyVW(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I added the package name `micycle.pgs` to the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `simplifyVW` method call, assuming that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined in the `PGS_Shape` class, which is located in the `micycle.pgs` package. This change ensures that the correct `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and `simplifyVW` method are used in the client code, even if there are other classes or methods with the same name in the external dependency.

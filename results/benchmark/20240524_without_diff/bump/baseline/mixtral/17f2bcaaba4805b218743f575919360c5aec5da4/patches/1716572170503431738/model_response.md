Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```

In this patch, we replace the static import of `assumeTrue` with an import of the `Assume` class, and then call the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class. This should fix the error message about static imports only being allowed from classes and interfaces.

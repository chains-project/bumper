Here's a possible patch to fix the error:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyVW() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.simplifyVW(micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I added the package name `micycle.pgs` to the `GROUP_SHAPE` and `simplifyVW` method calls. This is because the `cannot find symbol` error suggests that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is not in the current scope. By adding the package name, we can ensure that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is referenced correctly.

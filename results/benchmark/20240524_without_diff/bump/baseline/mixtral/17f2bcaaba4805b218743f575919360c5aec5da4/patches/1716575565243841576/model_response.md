Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
    assumeTrue(ProcessingShapeUtil.getGroupChildCount(GROUP_SHAPE) == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.smoothGaussian(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    assertEquals(2, ProcessingShapeUtil.getGroupChildCount(out));
}
```

Assuming that the failure is caused by the `getChildCount()` method being removed from the `PShape` class, we can create a utility method `getGroupChildCount()` that performs the same functionality. This method can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class ProcessingShapeUtil {
    public static int getGroupChildCount(PShape groupShape) {
        int childCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < groupShape.getChildCount(); i++) {
            childCount += groupShape.getChild(i) instanceof PShape ? 1 : 0;
        }
        return childCount;
    }
}
```

Note that this implementation assumes that the `getChild()` method is still available in the `PShape` class. If this method is also removed, you may need to modify the `getGroupChildCount()` method accordingly.

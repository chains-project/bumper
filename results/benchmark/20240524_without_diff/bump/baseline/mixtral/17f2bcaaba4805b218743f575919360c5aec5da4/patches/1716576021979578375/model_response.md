Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException;
import org.junit.internal.Assume;

// ...

try {
    Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
} catch (AssumptionViolatedException e) {
    throw e;
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assumeTrue` method is a static method of the `Assume` class, which is an internal class of JUnit. Therefore, we cannot use a static import for this method.
To fix the error, we can import the `Assume` class and call the `assumeTrue` method as a regular method. If the assumption is violated, an `AssumptionViolatedException` will be thrown, which we can catch and rethrow to preserve the original behavior.
Note that we cannot simply remove the `@Override` annotation from the method, as this would change the method signature. Therefore, we need to wrap the call to `assumeTrue` in a try-catch block to avoid throwing an exception in the test method.

Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("minkSum returned null");
    }
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `out` variable might be `null`, which would cause a `NullPointerException` on the call to `getChildCount()`. To fix this, I added a null check and used JUnit's `fail()` method to indicate that the test failed.

Note that I did not change any external dependencies or library methods, as I assumed that this was not allowed based on the prompt.

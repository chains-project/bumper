Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0); // changed from -1 to -1.0
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The only change I made was to change the second argument of the `buffer` method from `-1` to `-1.0`. This is because the `buffer` method expects a `float` argument, and `-1` is an integer literal. By changing it to `-1.0`, we ensure that the argument is a `float` and avoid the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class and the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable are defined somewhere in the client code and are not part of the failing code snippet. If these are not defined or have changed in the new version, then the patch may not work.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code. I'm assuming that the `PGS_Morphology` class or its `simplify` method has been changed and no longer accepts a `PShape` object directly. Instead, it might require a `Group` object now.

Based on this assumption, I added a new method `getGroupShape` that returns a `Group` object, and then use this method to pass the required argument to the `simplify` method.

```java
import processing.core.PApplet;
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // ...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_simplify() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.simplify(getGroupShape(), 1);
        assertNotNull(out);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }

    private Group getGroupShape() {
        return (Group) GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    }
}
```

Note that this solution might not work if the `PGS_Morphology` class or the `simplify` method requires a different argument or has a different behavior in the updated version. In this case, you might need to adjust the solution accordingly.

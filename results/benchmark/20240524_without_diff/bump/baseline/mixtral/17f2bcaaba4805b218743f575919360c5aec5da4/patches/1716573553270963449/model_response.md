Here is a possible patch for the given client code:
```java
import processing.core.PApplet;
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // ... other code ...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
        PApplet.runSketch(new Sketch() {
            public void settings() {
                size(100, 100);
            }

            public void draw() {
                mink.beginShape();
                mink.vertex(0, 0);
                mink.vertex(5, 0);
                mink.vertex(5, 5);
                mink.vertex(0, 5);
                mink.endShape(CLOSE);
            }
        }, this);

        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }

    // ... other code ...
}
```
The patch creates a new `Sketch` object and overrides its `settings()` and `draw()` methods to create the `mink` shape. This is necessary because the library method that was used to create shapes has been removed. The `PApplet.runSketch()` method is used to run the sketch and create the shape.

Note that this patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` object has been defined elsewhere in the code. Also, it assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class and the `minkDifference()` method are still available and have not been removed or changed in a way that would cause this code to fail.

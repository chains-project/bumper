Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The only change made is to pass a `float` value instead of an `int` value to the `buffer` method. This is because the `buffer` method may have been updated in the external dependency to accept a `float` value instead of an `int` value. By passing a `float` value, we ensure that the code is compatible with the updated method signature.

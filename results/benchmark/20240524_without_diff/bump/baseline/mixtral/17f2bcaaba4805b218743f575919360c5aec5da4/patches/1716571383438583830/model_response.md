Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(getGroupShape(), 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape getGroupShape() {
    return GROUP_SHAPE;
}
```

The patch creates a new helper method `getGroupShape()` that returns the `GROUP_SHAPE` object, and replaces direct references to `GROUP_SHAPE` with calls to `getGroupShape()`. This ensures that the code is not directly dependent on the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and can still access it via the helper method.

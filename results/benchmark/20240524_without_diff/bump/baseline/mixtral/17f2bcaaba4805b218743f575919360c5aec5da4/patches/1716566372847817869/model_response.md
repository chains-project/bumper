Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I replaced `PGS_Morphology` with `Morphology` since the former might have been removed or renamed. This assumes that `Morphology` is a valid class that contains the necessary methods and fields. If it is not, you may need to replace it with the appropriate class name. Additionally, I qualified `GROUP_SHAPE` with `Morphology.` to ensure that it is properly resolved.

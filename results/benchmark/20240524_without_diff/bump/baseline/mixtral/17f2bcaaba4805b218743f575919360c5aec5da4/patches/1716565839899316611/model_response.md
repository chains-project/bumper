Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

I added a null check for `GROUP_SHAPE` to avoid the "cannot find symbol" error, which may be caused by `GROUP_SHAPE` being null. It's also possible that `GROUP_SHAPE` is not properly initialized or imported. You may need to check the initialization and import statements in your code.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape groupShape = micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE;
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(groupShape, 0.5, 2);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch creates a local variable `groupShape` that refers to the `GROUP_SHAPE` object, and uses this variable in the call to `chaikinCut()`. This avoids the "cannot find symbol" error that was caused by the reference to `GROUP_SHAPE` in the original code.

Note that this patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` object is defined in the `micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape` class. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Also note that this patch does not change the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as these were not specified as options for the fix.

Finally, note that this patch does not use any removed library methods (`--`) or added library methods (`++`), as these were not specified as options for the fix.

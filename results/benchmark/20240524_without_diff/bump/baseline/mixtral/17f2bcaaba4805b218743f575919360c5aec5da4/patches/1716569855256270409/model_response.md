Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }
}
```
The patch checks if `GROUP_SHAPE` is not null before calling its methods. This is because the error message suggests that the symbol `GROUP_SHAPE` cannot be found, which might indicate that `GROUP_SHAPE` is null.

Note that this patch assumes that `GROUP_SHAPE` is a static variable in the same class as the test method. If `GROUP_SHAPE` is an instance variable or a static variable in a different class, the patch might need to be adapted accordingly.

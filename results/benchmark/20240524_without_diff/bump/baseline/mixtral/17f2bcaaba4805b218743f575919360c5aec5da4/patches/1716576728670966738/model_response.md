Here's a fixed version of the provided client code:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    int childCount = out.getChildCount();
    assertEquals(2, childCount);
}
```

The issue with the original code was the use of an underscore `_` in the variable name `out`, which is not a valid identifier in Java. I replaced it with the valid variable name `childCount`.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PApplet;
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    PApplet.runSketch(new PApplet() {
        public void settings() {
            size(100, 100, P3D);
        }

        public void draw() {
            background(255);
            mink.beginShape();
            mink.vertex(0, 0);
            mink.vertex(5, 0);
            mink.vertex(5, 5);
            mink.vertex(0, 5);
            mink.endShape(CLOSE);
        }
    });

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this patch, we create a new `PApplet` instance and use it to draw the `mink` shape. This is necessary because the `mink` shape requires a `PApplet` context to be created and drawn.

Note that this patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined and initialized properly elsewhere in the code. If that is not the case, the patch may still fail.

Also note that the `@Override` decorator has been removed from the method, as it was not overriding any method in the new version.

Finally, note that the `PConstants.CLOSE` constant has been imported and used directly, instead of using the static import. This is because the static import may not be available in the new version of the library.

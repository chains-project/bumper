Here is a proposed patch:

```java
import org.processing.core.PShape;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
import org.junit.Test;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.getGroupShapeChildCount() == 2);
    PShape groupShape = PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape();
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(groupShape, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

I made the following changes:

* I added imports for the `PShape` class, as well as the `assertEquals` and `assumeTrue` methods.
* I replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable with a call to the new `PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape()` method, which returns the same `PShape` object.
* I replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount()` expression with a call to the new `PGS_Morphology.getGroupShapeChildCount()` method, which returns the same value.

I assume that the `PGS_Morphology` class has been updated to include these new methods, and that they can be used to access the `GROUP_SHAPE` object and its properties.

I also added the `@Test` annotation to the method, in case it was removed in the original code. This annotation is required for the method to be recognized as a test case by the testing framework.

Note that I do not know the exact details of the `PGS_Morphology` class, so I made some assumptions about its methods and properties. You may need to adjust the code to fit the actual implementation of this class.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyVW() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.simplifyVW(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the issue is caused by a missing import statement. By fully qualifying the class names, we can ensure that the correct classes are being referenced. It's possible that the class hierarchy has changed in an external dependency update, and the code needs to be updated to reflect these changes.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    final var groupShape = Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE;
    assumeTrue(groupShape.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(groupShape, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The patch removes the '\' character from the `Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE` reference, which was causing the error message.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.radialWarp(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this patch, I added the `Morphology.` prefix to the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `radialWarp` method. This is because the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `radialWarp` method are not directly accessible from the `PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests` class. By adding the `Morphology.` prefix, we can access the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `radialWarp` method from the `Morphology` class.

Note that I made this assumption because the error message suggests that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable cannot be found. By adding the `Morphology.` prefix, we can access the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `radialWarp` method from the `Morphology` class.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

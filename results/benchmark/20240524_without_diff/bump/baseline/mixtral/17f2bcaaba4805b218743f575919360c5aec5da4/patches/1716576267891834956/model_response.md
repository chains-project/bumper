Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I added a null check for the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable before accessing its `getChildCount()` method. This should prevent the "cannot find symbol" error from occurring. Additionally, I added a null check for `GROUP_SHAPE` before comparing its `getChildCount()` result with an integer.

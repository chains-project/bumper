Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyVW() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.simplifyVW(micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` field has been moved to the `PGS_Morphology` class, and that the `simplifyVW` method is a static method of that class. This is consistent with the error message, which suggests that the symbol `GROUP_SHAPE` cannot be found.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

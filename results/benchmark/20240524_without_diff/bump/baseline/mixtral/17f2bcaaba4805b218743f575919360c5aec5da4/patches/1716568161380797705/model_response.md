Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    if (out != null && out.getChildCount() >= 0) { // added null check and child count check
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null PShape with at least one child.");
    }
}
```

This patch adds a null check and a check for the child count of the `PShape` returned by `PGS_Morphology.round()`. If the `PShape` is null or has a negative child count, the test will fail with a descriptive error message.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.round()` method may return null or a `PShape` with a negative child count in some cases. If this assumption is incorrect, the patch may not be necessary. However, it is always a good practice to check for null and negative values in Java code to avoid `NullPointerException`s and other runtime errors.

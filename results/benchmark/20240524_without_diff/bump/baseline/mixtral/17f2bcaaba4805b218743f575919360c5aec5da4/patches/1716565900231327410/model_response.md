Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0f); // changed int to float
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The only change I made is to change the second argument of the `buffer` method from an `int` to a `float`. This is because the `buffer` method in the `PGS_Morphology` class may have been updated to accept a floating-point value instead of an integer. By changing the argument to a float, the code should be able to compile and run without errors.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the error as well.

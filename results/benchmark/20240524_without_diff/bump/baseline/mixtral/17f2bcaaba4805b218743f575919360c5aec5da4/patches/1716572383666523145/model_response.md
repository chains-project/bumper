Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1, true);
    assertEquals(2, parent.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I added a third argument `true` to the `PGS_Morphology.buffer` method call. This argument specifies whether to return the parent PShape or the buffer PShape. By returning the parent PShape, we can avoid the "cannot find symbol" error caused by the removed library method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.buffer` method has been updated to accept a third argument. If this is not the case, then the patch may not work as intended.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(PApplet.parseInt(PApplet.getText("GROUP_SHAPE_CHILD_COUNT")) == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(getGroupShape(), 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape getGroupShape() {
    // Implement the logic to get the GROUP_SHAPE here
    // For example, you can load it from a file or create it programmatically
}
```

In this patch, I made the following changes:

1. Replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable with a call to a new `getGroupShape()` method.
2. Changed the `assumeTrue()` call to use `PApplet.parseInt()` to parse the `GROUP_SHAPE_CHILD_COUNT` value from a string.
3. Added a new `getGroupShape()` method that you can implement to get the `GROUP_SHAPE` object.

Note that you need to implement the `getGroupShape()` method to provide the actual `GROUP_SHAPE` object.

Also, note that the `PApplet.getText()` method is an added library method identified with `++`, which you can use to get the `GROUP_SHAPE_CHILD_COUNT` value from a configuration file or a property file.

Finally, note that the `assumeTrue()` method is not overriding any method in the new version, so you can safely remove the `Override` decorator.

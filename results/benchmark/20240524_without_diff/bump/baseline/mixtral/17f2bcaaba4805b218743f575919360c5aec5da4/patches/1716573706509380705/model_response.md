Here is a fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The only change I made was to replace the deprecated `new PShape(PShape.PATH)` constructor with the `createShape(PATH)` method, which is its recommended replacement. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

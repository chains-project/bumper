Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

SegmentString segmentString = new SegmentString(); // replace with your own initialization

int size = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
size += new MinHeap().size();
size += new MinMaxHeap().size();

// use 'size' variable as needed
```

This patch imports the new classes that were added in the updated library version and uses their `size()` methods to compute a `size` variable. You can use this variable as needed in your code. Note that the `SegmentString` initialization is left as a placeholder for you to replace with your own code.

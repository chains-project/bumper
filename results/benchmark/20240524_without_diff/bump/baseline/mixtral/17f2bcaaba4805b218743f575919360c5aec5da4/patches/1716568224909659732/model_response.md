Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplify() {
    assumeTrue(new PGS_Morphology().getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = new PGS_Morphology().simplify(new PGS_Morphology().getGroupShape(), 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch creates a new instance of `PGS_Morphology` to access the `getGroupShape` method and the `simplify` method. It's assumed that the `PGS_Morphology` class has a `getGroupShape` method that returns a `PShape` object. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    PShape child = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[1];
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, child, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this patch, I assumed that the failure is caused by the fact that the `buffer` method of the `PGS_Morphology` class no longer accepts a `PShape` object as its first argument, but instead requires two separate `PShape` objects as its first and second arguments. To accommodate this change, I extracted the children of the `GROUP_SHAPE` object into separate `PShape` variables, `parent` and `child`, and passed them as the first and second arguments to the `buffer` method, respectively. I then checked that the resulting `PShape` object, `out`, has two children, as expected.

Note that this patch may not be the only possible solution to the failure, and it may not work if the `PGS_Morphology` class has undergone other changes that are not reflected in the error message. However, it should give you a general idea of how to modify the client code to adapt to the updated dependency.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testMorphologyGroupShape() {
        assumeTrue(false); // replace this with the actual condition
        // ... rest of the test method
    }
}
```

This patch removes the static import statement, which is causing the compilation error. Instead, it imports the `Assert` class from JUnit directly. The `assumeTrue` method is now imported from `org.junit.Assert` and used without the static import.

Note that the `assumeTrue` method call should be replaced with the actual condition that you want to check. In the example above, it is replaced with `assumeTrue(false)` as a placeholder.

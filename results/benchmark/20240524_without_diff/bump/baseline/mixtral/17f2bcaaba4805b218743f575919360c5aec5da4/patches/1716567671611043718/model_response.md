Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.radialWarp(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I assumed that the issue is caused by a missing or renamed `GROUP_SHAPE` object. I replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` reference in the `assumeTrue` and `radialWarp` calls with `Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE`, assuming that `Morphology` is the class where `GROUP_SHAPE` is defined. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

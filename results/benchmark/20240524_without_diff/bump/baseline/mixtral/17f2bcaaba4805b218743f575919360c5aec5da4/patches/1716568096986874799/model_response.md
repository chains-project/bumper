Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(PApplet.prototype.getChildCount.call(GROUP_SHAPE) == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, PApplet.prototype.getChildCount.call(out));
}
```

This patch uses the `PApplet.prototype.getChildCount` method to access the `getChildCount` method of the `PApplet` class. This is because the `getChildCount` method is no longer available directly on the `PShape` class in the updated version of the external dependency.

The `PApplet.prototype.getChildCount` method is added in the updated version of the external dependency, so it can be used to access the `getChildCount` method of the `PApplet` class.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplify() {
    assumeTrue(getShapeManager().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.simplify(getShapeManager(), 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape getShapeManager() {
    return GROUP_SHAPE;
}
```

This patch creates a new helper method `getShapeManager()` that returns the `GROUP_SHAPE` object, which is then used in the `test_PGS_Morphology_simplify()` method.

Note: This patch assumes that the issue is caused by a missing or renamed `GROUP_SHAPE` object. If the issue is caused by a missing or renamed external dependency, you may need to modify the client code to import or use the correct dependency.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.ignore;
```

This patch imports the `ignore` method from the `org.junit.Assert` class, which can be used as a replacement for the deprecated `@Ignore` annotation.

Note: This patch assumes that the `ignore` method is available in the version of the JUnit library that the client code is using. If that's not the case, a different approach may be needed.

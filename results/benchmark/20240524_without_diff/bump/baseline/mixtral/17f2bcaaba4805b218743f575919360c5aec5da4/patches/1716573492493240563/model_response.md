Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    int expectedChildCount = 2; // add this line
    assertEquals("The child count of the result should be 2", expectedChildCount, out.getChildCount()); // modify this line
}
```
The patch adds a new variable `expectedChildCount` to store the expected child count of the result shape, and modifies the assertion message to provide more context about the expected and actual values.

Note that the patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class and the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable are defined elsewhere in the code, and that the `minkDifference` method takes two `PShape` arguments and returns a `PShape` object. The patch also assumes that the `PShape` class and the `CLOSE` constant are defined in the `processing.core` package.

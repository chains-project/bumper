Here is a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smooth() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape pgsInstance = PGS_Morphology.INSTANCE.smooth(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    PShape out = pgsInstance;
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `pgsInstance` to store the result of the `smooth` method call. This is because the `smooth` method may return a different object type in the updated version of the external dependency. The `pgsInstance` variable is then assigned to the `out` variable, so that the rest of the test code can still work as before.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class has a static field `INSTANCE` that points to a valid instance of the `PGS_Morphology` class. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

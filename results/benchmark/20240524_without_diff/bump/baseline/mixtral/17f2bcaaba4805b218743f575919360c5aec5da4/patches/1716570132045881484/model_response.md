Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(hasTwoChildren(GROUP_SHAPE));
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, getChildCount(out));
}

private boolean hasTwoChildren(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount() == 2;
}

private int getChildCount(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount();
}
```

In this patch, I created two helper methods `hasTwoChildren` and `getChildCount` to wrap the calls to `getChildCount` method of the `PShape` class. This way, the code is more readable and maintainable.

Please note that this patch assumes that the issue is caused by a missing or renamed `getChildCount` method in the `PShape` class. If this is not the case, the patch might not work.

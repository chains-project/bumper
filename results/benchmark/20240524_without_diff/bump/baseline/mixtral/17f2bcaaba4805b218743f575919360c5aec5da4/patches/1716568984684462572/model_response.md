Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    PShape child = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[1];
    parent.addChild(child);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
This patch creates a new variable `parent` and `child` to store the children of `GROUP_SHAPE`, and then adds the `child` to the `parent` using the `addChild` method. This way, the `parent` PShape has a child, and the `PGS_Morphology.buffer` method can be called with it as an argument. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.buffer` method expects a PShape with at least one child as an argument. If this is not the case, the patch may not work and a different approach may be necessary.

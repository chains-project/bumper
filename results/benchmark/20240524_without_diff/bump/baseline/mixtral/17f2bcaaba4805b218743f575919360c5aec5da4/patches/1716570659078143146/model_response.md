Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The only change I made is to replace the occurrences of `PConstants.CLOSE` with `CLOSE`. This is because the `PConstants` class was imported statically at the beginning of the code, so we can directly use its constants without prefixing them with the class name.

Note that this patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined and initialized somewhere in the enclosing class. If this is not the case, then the error might be caused by a missing or incorrect initialization of `GROUP_SHAPE`.

Also note that this patch does not change the behavior of the code, it just makes it more concise and readable. If the error is caused by a different issue, then this patch might not be sufficient to fix it.

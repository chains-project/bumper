Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(PApplet.parseInt(PApplet.getText("GROUP_SHAPE_CHILD_COUNT")) == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(loadingPApplet.g, PApplet.parseFloat(PApplet.getText("GROUP_SHAPE")));
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I made the following changes:

* Replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` constant with a call to `PApplet.getText("GROUP_SHAPE")` to load the value from a properties file or a similar configuration source.
* Replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount()` method call with `PApplet.parseInt(PApplet.getText("GROUP_SHAPE_CHILD_COUNT"))` to load the child count value from a properties file or a similar configuration source.
* Replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` argument of the `PGS_Morphology.round()` method call with `loadingPApplet.g` to use the current PApplet's graphics object instead of a static variable.
* Added a `loadingPApplet` variable at the beginning of the test class, which should be initialized before running the test.

Note that these changes assume that the `PGS_Morphology.round()` method can handle a `PGraphics` object as its first argument, and that the child count value can be passed as a string. If these assumptions are incorrect, additional changes may be necessary.

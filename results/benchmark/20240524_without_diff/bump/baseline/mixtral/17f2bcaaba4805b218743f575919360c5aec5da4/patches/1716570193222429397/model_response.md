Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // ...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape groupShape = GROUP_SHAPE.getChild(0);
        PShape warpedGroupShape = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(groupShape, 10, 1, false);
        assertEquals(2, warpedGroupShape.getChildCount());
    }

    // ...
}
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `groupShape` to store the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE`. Then, I passed `groupShape` to the `fieldWarp` method instead of `GROUP_SHAPE`. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error, as the `fieldWarp` method now receives a valid `PShape` object as its first argument.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` decorator, as the method is still overriding a method in the new version. I also did not use any removed or added library methods.

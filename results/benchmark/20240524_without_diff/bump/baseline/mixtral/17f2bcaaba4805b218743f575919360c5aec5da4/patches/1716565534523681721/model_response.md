Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is a static method in the `org.junit` package. Therefore, we can simply remove the static import and use the fully qualified name of the method instead. This will not affect the functionality of the code, since the method is still being called in the same way.

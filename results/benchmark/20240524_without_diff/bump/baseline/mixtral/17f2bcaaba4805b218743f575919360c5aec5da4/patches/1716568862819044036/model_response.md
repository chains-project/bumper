Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, `org.junit.Assume` is a class, so we can import it directly instead of using a static import.

To fix the error, we can replace the static import statement with a regular import statement for the `Assume` class. We can then call the `assumeTrue` method directly on the `Assume` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the code is using a version of JUnit that includes the `Assume` class. If the code is using an older version of JUnit that does not include `Assume`, then a different solution may be necessary.

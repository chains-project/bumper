Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    beginShape(mink);
    vertex(0, 0);
    vertex(5, 0);
    vertex(5, 5);
    vertex(0, 5);
    endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added the necessary import statements for `PShape`, `PConstants`, and `processing`.
* I replaced `new PShape(PShape.PATH)` with `createShape(PATH)` to create the `PShape` object.
* I added `beginShape(mink)` before adding vertices to the `PShape` object.

This patch should fix the error by providing the necessary imports for the code to compile and by using the correct method to create the `PShape` object.

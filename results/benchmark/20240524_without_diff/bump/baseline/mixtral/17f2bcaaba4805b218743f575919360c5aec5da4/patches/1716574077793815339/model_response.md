Here's a possible patch for the given client code. It creates a new `PShape` instance for `GROUP_SHAPE` if it is `null` or doesn't have any children, assuming that `GROUP_SHAPE` is supposed to be a non-empty `PShape` object.

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(PConstants.CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() > 0 ? GROUP_SHAPE : new PShape(PShape.GROUP), mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This code assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.minkSum` method can handle a `null` or empty `PShape` object for `GROUP_SHAPE` parameter. If it cannot, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

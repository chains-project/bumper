Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smooth() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChild(0);
    PShape child = GROUP_SHAPE.getChild(1);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.smooth(parent, child, 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
I assume that the `smooth` method of `PGS_Morphology` class has been changed in a way that it no longer accepts a `PShape` group as its first argument, but instead requires separate `PShape` objects as its first two arguments. I also assume that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is still a valid `PShape` group with two children.

To fix the error, I created two new variables `parent` and `child` to store the first and second child of the `GROUP_SHAPE` respectively. Then I passed `parent` and `child` variables as the first two arguments of the `smooth` method, along with the `0.5` as the third argument.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the error depending on the specific changes made to the `smooth` method.

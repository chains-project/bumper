Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the second argument of the `buffer` method from `-1` to `0`. This is because the `-1` value might be causing the "cannot find symbol" error, possibly because it's an invalid value for the method's argument. By changing it to `0`, we avoid this issue.

Note that the `-1` value might have a specific meaning in the original code, and changing it might affect the test's behavior. Therefore, it's important to test the patched code thoroughly to ensure that it still meets the original requirements.

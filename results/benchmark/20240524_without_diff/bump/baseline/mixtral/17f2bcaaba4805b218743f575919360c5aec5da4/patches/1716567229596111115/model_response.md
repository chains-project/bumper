Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.setStroke(false);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added an import statement for `PConstants.CLOSE` to avoid the "cannot find symbol" error.
* I added a `setStroke(false)` call on the `mink` shape to avoid any potential issues with stroke weight or color that might be causing the failure.

Note that these changes are just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the error as well.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assumeTrue` method is a static method of the `Assume` class. Therefore, we can replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then call the `assumeTrue` method using the class name. This should resolve the compilation error.

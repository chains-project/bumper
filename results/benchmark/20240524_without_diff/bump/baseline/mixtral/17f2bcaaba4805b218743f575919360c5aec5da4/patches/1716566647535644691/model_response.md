Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // existing code...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape groupShapeCopy = GROUP_SHAPE.getChild(0).copy();
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(groupShapeCopy, 10, 1, false);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }

    // existing code...

}
```
In this patch, we create a copy of the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE` using the `copy()` method, which is an added method identified with `++`. We then pass this copy to the `fieldWarp()` method instead of `GROUP_SHAPE` itself. This should fix the error caused by the missing symbol, as the `fieldWarp()` method may be expecting a different type of object than `GROUP_SHAPE`.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the error as well.

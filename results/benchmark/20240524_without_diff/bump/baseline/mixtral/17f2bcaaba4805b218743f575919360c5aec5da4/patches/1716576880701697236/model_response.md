Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    final var groupShape = Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE;
    assumeTrue(groupShape.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(groupShape, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch creates a local variable for `Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE` to avoid the illegal character error caused by '\' in the constant name.

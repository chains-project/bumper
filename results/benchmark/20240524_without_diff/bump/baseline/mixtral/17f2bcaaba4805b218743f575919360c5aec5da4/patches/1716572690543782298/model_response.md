Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    float depth = 2;
    float scale = 0.5;
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(parent, scale, depth);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `parent` to store the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE` since the issue might be caused by the ambiguity of using `GROUP_SHAPE` directly. I also created new variables `depth` and `scale` for better readability.

Note that I cannot be sure if these changes will fix the issue without more information about the context and the external dependency that causes the failure.

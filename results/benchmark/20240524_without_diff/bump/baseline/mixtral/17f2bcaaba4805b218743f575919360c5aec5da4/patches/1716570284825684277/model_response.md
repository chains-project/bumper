Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    beginShape(mink);
    vertex(0, 0);
    vertex(5, 0);
    vertex(5, 5);
    vertex(0, 5);
    endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added the import statements for `processing.core.PShape` and `processing.core.PConstants` to fix the "cannot find symbol" error.
* I replaced the constructor call `new PShape(PShape.PATH)` with the method call `createShape(PATH)` to create the `PShape` object.
* I replaced the method call `beginShape(mink, PShape.PATH)` with the method call `beginShape(mink)` to start drawing on the `PShape` object.

Note that these changes are based on the assumption that the `PGS_Morphology` class and the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable are defined and working correctly. If there are other issues with these components, the code may still fail.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createMinkShape();
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape createMinkShape() {
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);
    return mink;
}
```

This patch creates a new private method `createMinkShape()` that is responsible for creating the `PShape` object for the mink. This way, the test method itself is simpler and easier to read. Additionally, this approach follows the Single Responsibility Principle, which can help make the code more maintainable.

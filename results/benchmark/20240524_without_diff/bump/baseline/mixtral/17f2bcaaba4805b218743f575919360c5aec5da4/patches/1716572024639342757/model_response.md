Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

// ...

assertTrue(someCondition);
```
In this patch, I replaced the failing static import statement with a static import statement for `org.junit.Assert.assertTrue`, which is a similar method that can be used to assert a boolean condition. I also added a call to `assertTrue` with a boolean condition `someCondition` that needs to be evaluated. You should replace `someCondition` with the actual boolean expression that you want to test.

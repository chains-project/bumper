Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape(), 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

I made the following changes:

* I added an import statement for `processing.core.PShape` to resolve the `PShape` type.
* I replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable with `PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape()` to get the `PShape` object from the `PGS_Morphology` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class has a static method `getGroupShape()` that returns a `PShape` object. If this method does not exist or has a different signature, then the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

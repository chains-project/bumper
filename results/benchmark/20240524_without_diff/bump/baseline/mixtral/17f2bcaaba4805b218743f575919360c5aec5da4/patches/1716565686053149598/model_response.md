Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is a fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    @Test
    public void testMorphologyGroupShape() {
        // existing test code here
        // ...

        // replace assumeTrue() call with assert() call
        assertTrue("MorphologyGroupShape should not be null", morphologyGroupShape != null);

        // existing test code continues here
        // ...
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `assumeTrue()` is a method of the `Assume` class. To fix this, we can replace the `assumeTrue()` call with an equivalent `assert()` call from the `Assert` class, which is in the same package (`org.junit`) and can be imported without issues.

In this case, we can replace the `assumeTrue()` call with an `assertTrue()` call, which checks that the condition is true and throws an `AssertionError` if it is not. We pass the same condition and message to `assertTrue()` as we did to `assumeTrue()`.

Note that this fix assumes that the test will fail if `morphologyGroupShape` is null. If this is not the desired behavior, the test code may need to be modified accordingly.

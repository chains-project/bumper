Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I changed the second argument of the `PGS_Morphology.buffer()` method from an integer to a floating-point number. This is because the `buffer()` method may have been updated in the external dependency to only accept floating-point numbers as the second argument. By changing the argument to a floating-point number, the code should be able to compile and run successfully.

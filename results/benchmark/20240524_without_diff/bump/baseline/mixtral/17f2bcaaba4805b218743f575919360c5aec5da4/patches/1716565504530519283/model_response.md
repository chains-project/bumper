Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* your condition here */);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `org.junit.Assume` is an abstract class. Therefore, we need to import the class and use its static method directly. We can replace the failing line with the above code to fix the error. Note that we need to provide the condition to be checked in the `assumeTrue` method.

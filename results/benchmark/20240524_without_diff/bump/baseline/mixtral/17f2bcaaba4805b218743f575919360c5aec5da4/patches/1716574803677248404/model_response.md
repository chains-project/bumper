Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyVW() {
    assumeTrue(getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.simplifyVW(getGroupShape(), 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape getGroupShape() {
    return GROUP_SHAPE;
}
```

In this patch, I created a new helper method `getGroupShape()` that returns the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable. This way, the code is not directly dependent on the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable, making it more robust to changes in external dependencies.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp() {
    assumeTrue(getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.radialWarp(getGroupShape(), 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape getGroupShape() {
    return GROUP_SHAPE;
}
```

In this patch, I've added a new private method `getGroupShape()` that returns the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable, and replaced all occurrences of `GROUP_SHAPE` in the `test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp()` method with calls to `getGroupShape()`. This makes the code more modular and hides the implementation detail of `GROUP_SHAPE`, which may have been removed in the updated dependency.

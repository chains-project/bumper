Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    int expectedChildCount = 2; // add this line
    assertEquals("child count", expectedChildCount, out.getChildCount()); // modify this line
}
```

This patch adds a new variable `expectedChildCount` to store the expected child count, and modifies the assertion to include a message. This change will not affect the functionality of the code, but it will help with debugging by providing a clearer error message if the test fails.

Note that the patch does not change any external dependencies or library methods.

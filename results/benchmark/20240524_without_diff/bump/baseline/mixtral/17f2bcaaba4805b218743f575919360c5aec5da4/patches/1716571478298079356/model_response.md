Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code. I'm assuming that the missing symbol is the `PGS_Morphology` class. I noticed that the `PGS_Morphology` class is not imported in the code, so I added the import statement.

```java
import micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_simplifyTopology() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = new PGS_Morphology().simplifyTopology(GROUP_SHAPE, 1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch imports the missing `PGS_Morphology` class and creates a new instance of it before calling the `simplifyTopology` method. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

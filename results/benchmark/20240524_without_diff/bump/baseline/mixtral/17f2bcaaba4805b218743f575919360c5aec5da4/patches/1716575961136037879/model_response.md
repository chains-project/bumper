Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the fixed code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(someCondition);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces, but `Assume` is a static method in the `org.junit` package. Therefore, we can import the `Assume` class directly and call its `assumeTrue` method.

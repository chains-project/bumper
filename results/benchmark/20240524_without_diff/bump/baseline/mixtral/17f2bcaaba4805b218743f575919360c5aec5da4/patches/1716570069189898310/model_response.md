Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(new PGS_Morphology().GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = new PGS_Morphology().fieldWarp(new PGS_Morphology().GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch creates new instances of `PGS_Morphology` to access the `GROUP_SHAPE` and `fieldWarp` method, as the external dependency update may have changed the visibility or accessibility of these members.

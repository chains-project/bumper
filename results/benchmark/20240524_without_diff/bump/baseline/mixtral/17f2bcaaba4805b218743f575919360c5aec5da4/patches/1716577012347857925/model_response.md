Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
_erosionDilation() {
    Assume.assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    Assertions.assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The error message suggests that the illegal character is a backslash (`\`). This character is used in string literals to escape certain characters, such as a newline or a quote. However, it is not needed in this context.

In the original code, the `assert` keyword is used, which is a Java keyword. It looks like the backslash was mistakenly added before the `assert` keyword. To fix the error, I replaced the `assert` keyword with `Assertions.assertEquals`, which is a method from the JUnit library that can be used for assertions.

Note that I also imported the `Assertions` class at the beginning of the file:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
```
This import statement is needed to use the `Assertions.assertEquals` method.

Additionally, I replaced the `assumeTrue` method from the `Assert` class with the `Assume.assumeTrue` method from the `Assertions` class. This is because the `Assert.assumeTrue` method is deprecated in JUnit 5 and replaced with the `Assume.assumeTrue` method.

Overall, these changes should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0); // changed int to double
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I changed the second argument of the `buffer` method from `int` to `double`. This is because the `buffer` method may have been updated in the external dependency to accept a `double` value instead of an `int` value. By changing the argument type to `double`, the code should be able to compile and run successfully.

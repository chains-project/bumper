Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape sketch = new PShape();
    sketch.setChildCount(2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(sketch, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I created a new `PShape` object called `sketch` and set its child count to 2, so that the `erosionDilation` method can be called without any issues. I then passed `sketch` to the `erosionDilation` method instead of `GROUP_SHAPE`, so that the method can use `sketch` as its input. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error that you were encountering.

Note that this patch is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the error as well. It's always a good idea to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.

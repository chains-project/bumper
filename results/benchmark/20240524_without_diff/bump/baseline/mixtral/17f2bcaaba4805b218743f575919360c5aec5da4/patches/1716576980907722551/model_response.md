Here's a fixed version of the method, addressing the illegal character error:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    int outChildCount = out.getChildCount();
    assertEquals(2, outChildCount);
}
```

This code is identical to the original, except for the addition of a temporary variable `outChildCount`, which resolves the error caused by the invalid character.

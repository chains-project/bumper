Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. In this case, the `assumeTrue` method is a static method of the `Assume` class. Therefore, we can simply remove the static import and use the fully-qualified name of the method instead. This solution ensures that the code is still compatible with the updated version of the external dependency.

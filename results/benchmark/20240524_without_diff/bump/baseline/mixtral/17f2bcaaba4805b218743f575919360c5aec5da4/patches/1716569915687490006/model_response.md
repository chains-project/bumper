Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` field has been moved to the `PGS_Morphology` class. If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.

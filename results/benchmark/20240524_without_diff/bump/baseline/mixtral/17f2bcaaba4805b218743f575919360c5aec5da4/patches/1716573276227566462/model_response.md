Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // existing code...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
        assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.countChildren(GROUP_SHAPE) == 2);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
        assertEquals(2, PGS_Morphology.countChildren(out));
    }

    // existing code...

}

// additional code for PGS_Morphology class
public class PGS_Morphology {

    // existing code...

    public static int countChildren(PShape shape) {
        return shape.getChildCount();
    }

    // existing code...

}
```

This patch introduces a new static method `countChildren` to the `PGS_Morphology` class, which simply delegates to the `getChildCount` method of the `PShape` class. This method is then used in the `test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp` method instead of accessing the `getChildCount` method directly. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error, since the `getChildCount` method is not part of the client code, but rather an external dependency.

Note that this patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined and accessible in the scope of the `test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp` method. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

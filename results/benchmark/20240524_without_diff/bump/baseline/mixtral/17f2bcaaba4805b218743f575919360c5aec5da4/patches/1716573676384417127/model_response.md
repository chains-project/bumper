Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* Replace `PShape.PATH` with `PATH` in the creation of `mink`.
* Replace `PConstants.CLOSE` with `CLOSE` in the call to `endShape`.

These changes are necessary because the external dependency has removed the static imports for `PShape.PATH` and `PConstants.CLOSE`, and the client code needs to use the unqualified names instead.

Note: This patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `PGS_Morphology` class are defined elsewhere in the code and are not part of the failing client code.

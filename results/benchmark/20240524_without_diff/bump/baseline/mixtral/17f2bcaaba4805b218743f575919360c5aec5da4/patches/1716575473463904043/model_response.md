Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape pgs = PGS_Morphology.smoothGaussian(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    PShape out = pgs != null ? pgs : new PShape();
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch checks if the returned `PShape` object is not `null` and initializes a new `PShape` object if it is. This way, the code can still call `getChildCount()` method on `out` variable.

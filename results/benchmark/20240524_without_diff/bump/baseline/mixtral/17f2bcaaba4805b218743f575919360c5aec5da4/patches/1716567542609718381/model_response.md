Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null result.");
    }
}
```

The main change is the addition of a null check for the `out` variable, which is returned by the `PGS_Morphology.minkSum` method. It's possible that the method returns null under certain conditions, and the original code didn't handle that case properly.

Note that I added an `import` statement for `PConstants.CLOSE` to make the code more readable. Also, I added a `fail` statement to provide more information in case the `out` variable is null.

This patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined elsewhere in the code and is accessible from the test method. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```

This code imports the new classes that were added in the updated library version, creates instances of each of those classes, and calls their `size()` methods. The results of those calls are then summed up and returned.

Note that this code is just an example, and may not be suitable for your specific use case. You may need to modify it to fit your needs.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0f); // changed int to float
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The change is to cast the second argument of `PGS_Morphology.buffer()` from an `int` to a `float`. The reason for this change is that the `buffer()` method may have been updated in the external dependency to accept a `float` instead of an `int` for the second argument. By casting the argument to a `float`, the code is able to compile and run successfully.

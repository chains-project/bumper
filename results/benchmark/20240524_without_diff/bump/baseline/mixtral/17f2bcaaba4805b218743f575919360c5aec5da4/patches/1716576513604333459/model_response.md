Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren().get(0);
    float depth = 2f;
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(parent, 0.5f, depth);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `parent` to store the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE` and a new variable `depth` to store the value of the third argument of the method `chaikinCut()`. I then passed `parent` as the first argument of `chaikinCut()` instead of `GROUP_SHAPE`, and used `depth` instead of the literal value `2`. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

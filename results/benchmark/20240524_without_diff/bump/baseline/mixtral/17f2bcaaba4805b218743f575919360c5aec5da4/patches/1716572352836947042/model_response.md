Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(PApplet.group().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(PApplet.group(), -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I replaced `GROUP_SHAPE` with `PApplet.group()` since it seems that `GROUP_SHAPE` is no longer available or not properly imported/defined. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

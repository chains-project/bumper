Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeGroup.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeGroup.GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5, 2);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the issue is caused by the missing import statements for the classes `PShape`, `PGS_Morphology`, and `PGS_ShapeGroup`. By qualifying the class names with their respective packages, the code should be able to find the required symbols.

Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The only change I made is to pass a `double` value of `-1.0` to the `buffer` method instead of an `int` value of `-1`. This is because the `buffer` method may have been updated in the external dependency to expect a `double` value instead of an `int` value. By passing a `double` value, the code should be able to compile and run successfully.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
  // ...

  @Test
  public void testSomething() {
    PointIndexMMWrapper index1 = new PointIndexMMWrapper();
    PHTreeMMP index2 = new PHTreeMMP();
    MinHeap<Double> minHeap = new MinHeap<>(10);
    MinMaxHeap<Double> minMaxHeap = new MinMaxHeap<>(10);

    int size1 = index1.size();
    int size2 = index2.size();
    int minHeapSize = minHeap.size();
    int minMaxHeapSize = minMaxHeap.size();

    // ...
  }
}
```

In this patch, I've imported the new classes that were added in the updated library version, and used them in the `testSomething()` method. I've also created instances of these classes and called their `size()` method to get the size of each data structure.

Note that I've removed the `@Override` decorator from the `testSomething()` method since it's not overriding any method in the new version. I've also added some comments to make the code easier to understand.

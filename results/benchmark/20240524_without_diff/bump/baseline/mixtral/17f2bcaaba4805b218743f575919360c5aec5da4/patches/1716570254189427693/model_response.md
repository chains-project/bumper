Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    // Assuming that PGS_Morphology is a class you have written
    // and minkDifference is a static method in that class
    PShape out = minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class is a class you have written and that `minkDifference` is a static method in that class. If that is not the case, you will need to modify the patch accordingly.

The patch also removes the `@Override` decorator, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Note that the patch does not use any removed library methods identified with `--`, but it does use the `PShape` class and the `PConstants.CLOSE` constant, which are added library methods identified with `++`.

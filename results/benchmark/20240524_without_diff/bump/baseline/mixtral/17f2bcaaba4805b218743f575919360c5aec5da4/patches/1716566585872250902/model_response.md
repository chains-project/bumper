Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape erodedDilated = PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, erodedDilated.getChildCount());
}
```

I created a new variable `erodedDilated` to store the result of `PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(GROUP_SHAPE, 0)`, and used it in the `assertEquals` call. This way, the code should be able to compile and run correctly.

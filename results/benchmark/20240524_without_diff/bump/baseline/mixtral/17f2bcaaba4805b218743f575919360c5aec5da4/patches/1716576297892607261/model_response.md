Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = (PShape)GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren().get(0);
    PShape child = (PShape)GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren().get(1);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, child, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch modifies the `PGS_Morphology.buffer` method call to include the child shapes of `GROUP_SHAPE` as separate arguments, as the method signature has changed in the updated dependency. It also creates variables to hold the child shapes of `GROUP_SHAPE` to make the code easier to read.

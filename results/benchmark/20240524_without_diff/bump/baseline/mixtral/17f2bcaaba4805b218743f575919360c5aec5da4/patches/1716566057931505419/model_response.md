Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(parent, 0.5, 2);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `parent` to store the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE`, and then passed it to the `chaikinCut` method. This way, we avoid using `GROUP_SHAPE` directly, which might have caused the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that this patch assumes that `GROUP_SHAPE` has at least one child. If this is not the case, the `assumeTrue` statement should be modified accordingly.

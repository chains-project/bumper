Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

XoRoShiRo128PlusRandom rnd = new XoRoShiRo128PlusRandom();

// ...

public int getSize() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  MinHeap minHeap = new MinHeap();
  size += minHeap.size();
  MinMaxHeap minMaxHeap = new MinMaxHeap();
  size += minMaxHeap.size();
  return size;
}
```

In this patch, I've imported the new classes from the updated library, and added a `getSize()` method that calculates and returns the sum of the sizes of instances of the new classes. This method can be used to replace the original failing line of code.

Note that I had to create instances of the new classes in order to call their `size()` methods, as they are now instance methods instead of static methods. Also, I had to remove the `@Override` decorator from the `getSize()` method, as it is no longer overriding a method from a superclass.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException;
import org.junit.internal.AssumptionUtils;

// ...

try {
    AssumptionUtils.assumeTrue(condition);
} catch (AssumptionViolatedException e) {
    throw e;
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that static imports are only allowed from classes and interfaces. Since `Assume` is a class, we can't use a static import for its `assumeTrue` method. Instead, we can import the `AssumptionUtils` class and use its `assumeTrue` method.

The `AssumptionUtils` class has a non-static `assumeTrue` method that takes a `boolean` parameter and throws an `AssumptionViolatedException` if the condition is false. We can use this method instead of the static `assumeTrue` method.

To use the `AssumptionUtils` class, we need to import it and then call its `assumeTrue` method. We can catch the `AssumptionViolatedException` and rethrow it if necessary.

Note that this patch assumes that the `condition` variable is already defined in the client code. If it's not, you may need to define it before using it in the `assumeTrue` method.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    beginShape(mink);
    vertex(0, 0);
    vertex(5, 0);
    vertex(5, 5);
    vertex(0, 5);
    endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I imported the missing class `PShape` and the constant `CLOSE` from the `processing.core` package.
* I created the `mink` shape using the `createShape(int)` method instead of the `PShape(int)` constructor.
* I began the shape using the `beginShape(PShape)` method instead of the `beginShape()` method.

These changes should fix the "cannot find symbol" error by providing the necessary symbols for the code to compile. Note that these changes are based on the assumption that the `PGS_Morphology` class and the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable are defined and available in the client code. If this is not the case, then the error may be caused by other issues that are not addressed by this patch.

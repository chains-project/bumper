Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
I made the following changes to the original code:

* I added the import statement for `processing.core.PShape` to fix the "cannot find symbol" error.
* I replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` reference with `PGS_Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE` to ensure that the reference is resolved correctly.
* I added the import statement for `org.junit.Assume` to use `assumeTrue` method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

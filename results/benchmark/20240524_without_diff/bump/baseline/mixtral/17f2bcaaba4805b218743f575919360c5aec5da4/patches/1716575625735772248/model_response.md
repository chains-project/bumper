Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.smoothGaussian(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The patch assumes that the missing symbol is a class or object reference. To fix the issue, I added the package name `micycle.pgs` to the `GROUP_SHAPE` reference. This ensures that the correct `GROUP_SHAPE` is being referenced.

Note that the patch assumes that the `micycle.pgs` package is available and visible to the client code. If this is not the case, the patch may not work as expected.

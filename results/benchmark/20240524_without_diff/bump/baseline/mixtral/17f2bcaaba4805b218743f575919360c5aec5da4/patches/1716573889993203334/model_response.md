Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createMinkShape();
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape createMinkShape() {
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);
    return mink;
}
```

In this patch, I created a new private method called `createMinkShape()` that creates and returns the `PShape` object for the mink. This way, the creation of the mink shape is separated from the test logic, making the code easier to read and maintain.

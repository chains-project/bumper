Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp() {
    assumeTrue(hasTwoChildren(GROUP_SHAPE));
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.radialWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, getChildCount(out));
}

boolean hasTwoChildren(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount() == 2;
}

int getChildCount(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount();
}
```
This patch introduces two new private methods, `hasTwoChildren` and `getChildCount`, which are used to extract the logic of checking the child count of a `PShape` object. This way, the test method is more readable and easier to understand.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.radialWarp` method and the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable are defined and available in the client code. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

Also note that this patch does not modify the function signature, nor does it use any removed library methods or add any new ones. It only adds new variables and methods to make the code more readable and maintainable.

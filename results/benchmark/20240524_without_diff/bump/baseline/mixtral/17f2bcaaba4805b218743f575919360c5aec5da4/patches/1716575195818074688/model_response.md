Here's a possible patch for the given failing test method:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Assume;
import org.junit.Test;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smooth() {
    assumeTrue(PApplet.prototype.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.smooth(PApplet.prototype.GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is now a static property of the `PApplet` class. If that's not the case, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Note that the `@Override` annotation has been removed, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version. Also, the `assumeTrue` and `assertEquals` methods are still being used, as they are not marked with `--` in the error message.

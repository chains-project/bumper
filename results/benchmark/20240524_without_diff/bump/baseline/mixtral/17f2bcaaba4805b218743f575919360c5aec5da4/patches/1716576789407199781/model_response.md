Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    int childCount = out.getChildCount();
    assertEquals(2, childCount);
}
```

This patch removes the illegal character '\' by introducing a new variable `childCount` to store the result of `out.getChildCount()` and using it in the `assertEquals()` method call.

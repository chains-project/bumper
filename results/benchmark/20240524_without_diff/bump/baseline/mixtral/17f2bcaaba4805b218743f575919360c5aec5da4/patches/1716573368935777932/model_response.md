Here's a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
    assumeTrue(new PGS_Morphology().GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = new PGS_Morphology().fieldWarp(new PGS_Morphology().GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I created a new instance of `PGS_Morphology` to access the `GROUP_SHAPE` field. This is because the `GROUP_SHAPE` field might not be static or might not be initialized properly, causing the "cannot find symbol" error. By creating a new instance, we can ensure that the `GROUP_SHAPE` field is accessible.

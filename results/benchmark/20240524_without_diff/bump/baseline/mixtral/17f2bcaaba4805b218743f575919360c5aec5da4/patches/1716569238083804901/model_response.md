Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I've added a decimal point after the `-1` argument of the `buffer` method to make it a floating-point number. This change is necessary because the `buffer` method expects a floating-point number as its second argument, and the integer literal `-1` is not a valid argument.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class has not changed in a way that would affect the behavior of the `buffer` method. If the `buffer` method has been removed or modified in a way that is not compatible with the original code, then a different solution may be necessary.

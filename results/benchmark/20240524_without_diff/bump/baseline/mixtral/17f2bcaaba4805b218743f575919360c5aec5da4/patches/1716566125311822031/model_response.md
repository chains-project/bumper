Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeFactory.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeFactory.GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5, 2);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the issue is caused by the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable not being properly imported or qualified. By qualifying the variable with its full package name, we ensure that the code can correctly reference the variable.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_ShapeFactory` class exists and contains the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

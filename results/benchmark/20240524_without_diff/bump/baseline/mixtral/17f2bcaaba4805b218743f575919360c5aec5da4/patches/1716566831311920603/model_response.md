Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape groupShape = GROUP_SHAPE; // create a variable for GROUP_SHAPE
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(groupShape, 10, 1, false);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }
}
```

The patch creates a new variable `groupShape` to store the value of `GROUP_SHAPE`, and then passes `groupShape` to the `fieldWarp` method instead. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note: I am assuming that `GROUP_SHAPE` is defined elsewhere in the code and is not shown here. If `GROUP_SHAPE` is not defined, then the code will still fail to compile.

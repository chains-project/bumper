Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("minkSum returned null");
    }
}
```
I added a null check for the `out` variable before calling `assertEquals`, because it's possible that the `minkSum` method returns null if it fails to compute the minkowski sum. In this case, the test fails with a more informative message.

Note that I didn't use any added or removed library methods, and I didn't change the function signature. I also didn't create any new variables, but I did modify the existing code to handle the null case.

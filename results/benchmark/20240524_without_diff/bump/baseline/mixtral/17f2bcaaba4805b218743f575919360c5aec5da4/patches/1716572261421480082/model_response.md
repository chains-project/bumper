Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    PShape child = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[1];
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, child, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that `GROUP_SHAPE` is a `PShape` object with at least two children. Instead of passing `GROUP_SHAPE` directly to `PGS_Morphology.buffer()`, we extract its children and pass them as separate arguments. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error if it was caused by a change in the `PGS_Morphology` class that removed the ability to pass a `PShape` object with multiple children to `buffer()`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class has been updated to accept separate `PShape` objects for the parent and child shapes, as indicated by the `++` symbol. If this is not the case, then the patch may not work as expected.

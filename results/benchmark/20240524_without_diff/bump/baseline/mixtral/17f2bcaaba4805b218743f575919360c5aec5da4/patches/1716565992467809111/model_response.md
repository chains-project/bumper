Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0f); // changed int to float
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The patch changes the second argument of the `buffer` method from an `int` to a `float`, as the method may have been updated to accept a floating-point value instead of an integer. This change should allow the code to compile and run successfully.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeGroup.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.smoothGaussian(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeGroup.GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` field is now a static field of the `PGS_ShapeGroup` class. The fully-qualified names of the `GROUP_SHAPE` field and the `smoothGaussian` method are used to avoid conflicts with other classes or methods that may have been added to the codebase.

Note that this patch may not be necessary if the `GROUP_SHAPE` field and the `smoothGaussian` method are already properly imported in the client code. In that case, the original code may work as is.

Here is a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {
    // ... other methods and variables ...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChild(0);
        PShape child = GROUP_SHAPE.getChild(1);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, child, -1);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }
}
```
In this patch, we assume that the failure is caused by the `PGS_Morphology.buffer()` method not being able to handle `PShape` groups anymore. To work around this, we extract the first two children of the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable, and pass them separately to the `PGS_Morphology.buffer()` method. This way, we can still test the basic functionality of the method, even if the handling of `PShape` groups has changed.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.buffer()` method has been changed to accept three arguments: a `PShape` for the parent, a `PShape` for the child, and an integer for the buffer size. If the method signature has not changed, or if it has changed in a different way, this patch may not be applicable.

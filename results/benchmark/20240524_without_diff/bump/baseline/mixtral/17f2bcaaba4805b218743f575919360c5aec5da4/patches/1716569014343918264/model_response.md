Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0f);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I changed the second argument of the `buffer` method from an integer `-1` to a float `-1.0f`. This is because the `buffer` method may have been updated to accept a float instead of an integer for the second argument.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to fix the error as well.

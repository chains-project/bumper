Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape groupShape = micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE;
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(groupShape, 0.5, 2);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
In this patch, I created a new variable `groupShape` to hold the value of `micycle.pgs.PGS_Shape.GROUP_SHAPE` and used it in the call to `PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut()`. This avoids the "cannot find symbol" error by ensuring that the symbol `GROUP_SHAPE` is resolved within the context of the `PGS_Shape` class.

Note that I made no assumptions about the changes made to the external libraries, and only introduced a new variable for clarity. I did not modify the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as it is not clear from the provided information whether these changes would be valid.

Here's a potential patch for the given client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp() {
    assumeTrue(hasTwoChildren(GROUP_SHAPE));
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.radialWarp(GROUP_SHAPE, 10, 1, false);
    assertEquals(2, getChildCount(out));
}

private boolean hasTwoChildren(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount() == 2;
}

private int getChildCount(PShape shape) {
    return shape.getChildCount();
}
```

In this patch, I extracted the logic for checking the child count of a `PShape` into separate methods, `hasTwoChildren` and `getChildCount`. This way, the code is easier to read and understand. If the issue is caused by a missing or renamed library method, this patch should work around it. However, it is still important to investigate the root cause of the issue and update the external dependency accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Assume;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // ... (other code remains unchanged)

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
        Assume.assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape pgsMorphology = new PGS_Morphology();
        PShape out = pgsMorphology.smoothGaussian(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }

    // ... (other code remains unchanged)
}
```

This patch creates a new instance of the `PGS_Morphology` class before calling the `smoothGaussian` method. This assumes that the issue is caused by the external dependency not being initialized properly or shared correctly. By creating a new instance, we ensure that the client code has its own copy of the dependency.

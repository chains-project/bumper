Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    beginShape(mink);
    vertex(0, 0);
    vertex(5, 0);
    vertex(5, 5);
    vertex(0, 5);
    endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added the import statements for `processing.core.PShape` and `processing.core.PConstants` to avoid the "cannot find symbol" error.
* I replaced the deprecated `new PShape(PShape.PATH)` constructor with the recommended `createShape(PATH)` method.
* I added the `beginShape(mink)` call before the `vertex` calls to initialize the `mink` shape.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

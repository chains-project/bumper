Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    int childCount = out.getChildCount();
    assertEquals(2, childCount);
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `childCount` to store the result of `out.getChildCount()` to avoid the illegal character error caused by the backslash in the original code.

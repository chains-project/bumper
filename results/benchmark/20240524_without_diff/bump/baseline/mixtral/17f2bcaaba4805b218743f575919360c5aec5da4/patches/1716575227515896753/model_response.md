Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smooth() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape pgsMorphology = new PGS_Morphology();
    PShape out = pgsMorphology.smooth(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch creates a new instance of `PGS_Morphology` class, which may have been changed or removed in the new version of the external dependency. By creating a new instance, we ensure that the method `smooth` can be called and the test can be executed.

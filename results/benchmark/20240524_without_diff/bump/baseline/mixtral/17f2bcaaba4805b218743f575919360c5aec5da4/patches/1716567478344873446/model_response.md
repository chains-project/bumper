Here's a fixed version of the method. I added an import statement for `PShape` since it was missing and might have caused the "cannot find symbol" error.

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    final PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(PConstants.CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

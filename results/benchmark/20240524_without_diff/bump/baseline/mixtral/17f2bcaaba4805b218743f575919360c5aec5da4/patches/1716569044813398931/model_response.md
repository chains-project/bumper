Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1.0); // changed float argument to float literal
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The failure might be caused by a change in the external dependency, where the `buffer` method now requires a float argument instead of an int argument. The patch changes the argument from an integer literal to a float literal.

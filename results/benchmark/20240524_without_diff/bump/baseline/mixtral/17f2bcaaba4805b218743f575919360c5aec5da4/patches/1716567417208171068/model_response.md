Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null result from PGS_Morphology.minkSum()");
    }
}
```

The patch includes a null check for the `out` variable, which may be `null` if the `PGS_Morphology.minkSum()` method fails to create a valid shape. The `fail()` method is used to indicate a failed assertion in this case.

Note that the patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined and initialized correctly in the test class. If this is not the case, the test may still fail.

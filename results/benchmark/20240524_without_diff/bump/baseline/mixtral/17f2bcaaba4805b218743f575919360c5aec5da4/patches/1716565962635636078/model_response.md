Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.hasChildren(GROUP_SHAPE));
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    assertEquals(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount(), out.getChildCount());
}

// Add this method to the PGS_Morphology class
public static boolean hasChildren(PShape shape) {
    return shape != null && shape.getChildCount() > 0;
}
```

This patch adds a new method `hasChildren` to the `PGS_Morphology` class to check if a `PShape` object has any children. This method is used in the test case instead of accessing the `childCount` property of `GROUP_SHAPE` directly.

Note that the patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` object is defined and accessible in the test case. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the patch accordingly.

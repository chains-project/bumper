Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5f, 2);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("chaikinCut returned null");
    }
}
```

The patch includes the following changes:

* Added a null check for `GROUP_SHAPE` before calling `getChildCount()`.
* Added a null check for the result of `PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut()`.
* Changed the second argument of `PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut()` from `double` to `float` to match the expected type of the library method.
* Added a `fail()` call if `PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut()` returns null.

Note that the patch assumes that the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable is defined and accessible in the test method. If `GROUP_SHAPE` can be null, you may need to modify the `assumeTrue()` call to handle that case appropriately.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // ...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
        assumeTrue(getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(getGroupShape(), 10, 1, false);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }

    private PShape getGroupShape() {
        return GROUP_SHAPE;
    }
}
```
In this patch, I added a new private method `getGroupShape()` that returns the `GROUP_SHAPE` object. This way, the code is easier to read and maintain.

Note that I made this change assuming that `GROUP_SHAPE` is a valid `PShape` object in the context of the test. If this is not the case, the code may still fail with a different error message.

Also, note that I did not change the function signature or use any removed or added library methods.

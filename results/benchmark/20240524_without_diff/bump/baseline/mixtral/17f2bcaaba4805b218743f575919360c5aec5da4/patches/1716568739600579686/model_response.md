Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. Then, instead of using the static method `assumeTrue` directly, we use it through the `Assume` class. This way, we avoid the error message about static import only from classes and interfaces.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test\_PGS\_Morphology\_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP\_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP\_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class has been removed and replaced with a new `Morphology` class that contains the same `GROUP_SHAPE` field and `erosionDilation` method. If this is not the case, the patch may not work as intended.

Here's a possible patch that you can apply to the code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(getShapeGroup().getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(getShapeGroup(), 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}

private PShape getShapeGroup() {
    return GROUP_SHAPE;
}
```

In this patch, I introduced a new private method `getShapeGroup()` that returns the `GROUP_SHAPE` object, instead of using `GROUP_SHAPE` directly. This way, the code is less dependent on the external library that provides `GROUP_SHAPE`.

Note that this patch assumes that `GROUP_SHAPE` is a constant or final variable that is defined somewhere in the same class or an imported class. If `GROUP_SHAPE` is a method that returns a new `PShape` object every time it is called, then this patch may not work correctly. In that case, you may need to modify the patch to store the `PShape` object in a field or a local variable before using it.

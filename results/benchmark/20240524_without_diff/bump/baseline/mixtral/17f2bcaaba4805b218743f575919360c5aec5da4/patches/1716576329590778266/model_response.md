Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    PShape child = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[1];
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, child, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I've modified the `PGS_Morphology.buffer` method call to include the child shapes of `GROUP_SHAPE` explicitly. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error. Note that I've assumed that `GROUP_SHAPE` is a `PShape` object with at least two child shapes. If this assumption is incorrect, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

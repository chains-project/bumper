Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class, and then use the `assumeTrue` method by qualifying it with the `Assume` class name. This should fix the error message about static imports only being allowed from classes and interfaces.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;
```

This patch replaces the `junit.Assert` class with `junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` to fix the "cannot find symbol" error. The `assertTrue` method is available in both classes, but the import statement needs to be updated to reflect the new location of the method.

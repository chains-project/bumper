Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null shape from PGS_Morphology.minkDifference.");
    }
}
```
The proposed patch checks if the `out` variable is not null before calling `getChildCount()` to avoid the `cannot find symbol` error. This error might occur if the external dependency update removes a library method or changes its behavior.

Note: I added an import statement for `PConstants.CLOSE` and changed the name of the `mink` variable to make it easier to understand. These changes are optional and do not affect the functionality of the code.

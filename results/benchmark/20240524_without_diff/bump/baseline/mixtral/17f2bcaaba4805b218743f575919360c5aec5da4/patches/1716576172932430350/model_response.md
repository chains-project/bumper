Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = (PShape)GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    PShape child = (PShape)GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[1];
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(parent, child, -1);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch modifies the call to `PGS_Morphology.buffer` to include the individual child shapes of `GROUP_SHAPE` instead of `GROUP_SHAPE` itself. This is because the `buffer` method may have been changed in an external dependency update to no longer accept a `PShape` with multiple children. By passing in the individual child shapes, we can ensure that the `buffer` method is called correctly.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape erosionDilation = PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, erosionDilation.getChildCount());
}
```

The change I made was to assign the result of `PGS_Morphology.erosionDilation(GROUP_SHAPE, 0)` to a local variable `erosionDilation` before calling `getChildCount()` on it. This ensures that the `PShape` object returned by `erosionDilation` is not garbage collected before `getChildCount()` is called.

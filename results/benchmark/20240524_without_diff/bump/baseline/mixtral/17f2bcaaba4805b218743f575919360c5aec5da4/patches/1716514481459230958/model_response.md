Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```

This patch creates instances of the new classes that were added in the updated library version and calls their `size()` methods. The results are then summed up and returned. This approach assumes that the `size()` method of the new classes returns a value that can be added to the size of other collections. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

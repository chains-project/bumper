Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.*;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = createShape(PATH);
    beginShape(mink);
    vertex(0, 0);
    vertex(5, 0);
    vertex(5, 5);
    vertex(0, 5);
    endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added the necessary imports at the top of the file.
* I replaced the deprecated `new PShape(PShape.PATH)` constructor with `createShape(PATH)`.
* I replaced the `PShape.beginShape()` and `PShape.endShape()` methods with `beginShape(PShape)` and `endShape()`, respectively.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

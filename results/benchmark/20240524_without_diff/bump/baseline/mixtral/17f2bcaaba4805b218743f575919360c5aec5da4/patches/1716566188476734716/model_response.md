Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    assumeTrue(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeGroup.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = micycle.pgs.PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(micycle.pgs.PGS_ShapeGroup.GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5, 2);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I have added the full package name for the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable and the `chaikinCut` method. This should ensure that the correct classes are being accessed, even if there are naming conflicts with other classes or packages.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

Polygon polygon = ... // initialize your Polygon object

int size = new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
size += new MinHeap().size();
size += new MinMaxHeap().size();

// Use 'size' as needed
```
In this patch, I've imported the new classes from the updated library and used them to calculate the size. The `Override` decorator has been removed from the methods since they are not overriding any methods in the new version. The `Polygon` object creation is kept as is, assuming it is initialized correctly in the original code.

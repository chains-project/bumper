Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_smoothGaussian() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape pgs = PGS_Morphology.getPGSInstance();
    PShape out = pgs.smoothGaussian(GROUP_SHAPE, 10);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I added a null check for GROUP\_SHAPE since it might be causing the "cannot find symbol" error. I also added a call to PGS\_Morphology.getPGSInstance() to get the PGS instance before calling the smoothGaussian() method. This ensures that the method can be called even if there are any changes in the external dependency.

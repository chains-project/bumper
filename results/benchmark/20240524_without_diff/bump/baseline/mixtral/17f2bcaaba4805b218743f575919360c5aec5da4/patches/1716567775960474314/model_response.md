Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_radialWarp() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    float angle = 10;
    boolean clockwise = false;
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.radialWarp(parent, angle, 1, clockwise);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `parent` to store the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE` and passed it to the `radialWarp` method instead. I also created new variables `angle` and `clockwise` to replace the hard-coded values in the method call. This should fix the error caused by the missing symbol.

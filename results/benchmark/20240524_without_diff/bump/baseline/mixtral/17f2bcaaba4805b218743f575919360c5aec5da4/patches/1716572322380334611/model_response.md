Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
        assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1, new PShape[0]);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }
}
```
The patch adds a new argument `new PShape[0]` to the `buffer` method, which is an empty array of `PShape` objects. This change is necessary because the `buffer` method has been updated in the external dependency to require this argument.

The patch also imports the `PShape` class at the beginning of the file, which is used as the type of the new argument.

Note that the patch does not modify the function signature or remove the `@Override` decorator, as these were not required by the instructions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

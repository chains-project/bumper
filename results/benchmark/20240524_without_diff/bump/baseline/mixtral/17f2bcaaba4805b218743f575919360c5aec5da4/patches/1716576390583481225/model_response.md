Here's a proposed patch for the given failing client code. I added a null check for `GROUP_SHAPE` since the error message suggests that the symbol cannot be found.

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_chaikinCut() {
    if (GROUP_SHAPE != null && GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2) {
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.chaikinCut(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5, 2);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("GROUP_SHAPE is null or has incorrect child count");
    }
}
```

This patch checks if `GROUP_SHAPE` is not null and has the correct child count before proceeding with the test. If not, it fails the test with a custom message.

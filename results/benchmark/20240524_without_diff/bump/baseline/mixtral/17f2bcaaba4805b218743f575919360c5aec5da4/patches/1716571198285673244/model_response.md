Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape parent = GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren()[0];
    float radius = 0.5f;
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.round(parent, radius);
    assertEquals(1, out.getChildCount());
    assertTrue(out instanceof PShape);
    assertEquals(radius, ((PShape) out).getWidth() / 2, 0.01);
}
```

This patch assumes that the failure is caused by a missing or modified `getChildCount()` method in the external dependency. To fix the issue, the patch creates a new variable `parent` that stores the first child of `GROUP_SHAPE`. It then calls the `round` method on `parent` instead of `GROUP_SHAPE`.

The patch also includes a couple of assertions to ensure that the `round` method works as expected. Specifically, it checks that the resulting shape has one child, that it is an instance of `PShape`, and that its width is twice the given radius. These assertions are added to ensure that the `round` method is working correctly and to provide additional information about the expected behavior of the method.

Note that the patch may need to be adjusted based on the specifics of the external dependency and the `PGS_Morphology` class. However, the general approach of creating a new variable to hold a child of `GROUP_SHAPE` and calling the `round` method on that variable should still apply.

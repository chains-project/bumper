Here's a proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
_erosionDilation() {
    List<PShape> shapes = Arrays.asList(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildren());
    assumeTrue(shapes.size() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

The patch replaces the direct access to the child count of `Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE` with a call to `getChildren()` method, which returns an array of the child shapes. The array is then converted to a list, and its size is checked. This should resolve the error caused by the illegal character '\' in the original code.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;

public class PGS_MorphologyGroupShapeTests {

    // existing code...

    @Test
    void test_PGS_Morphology_fieldWarp() {
        assumeTrue(PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape().getChildCount() == 2);
        PShape out = PGS_Morphology.fieldWarp(PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape(), 10, 1, false);
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    }

    // existing code...

}
```
In this patch, I made the following changes:

* I imported the missing `processing.core.PShape` class, which is likely the symbol that could not be found.
* I replaced the `GROUP_SHAPE` variable with `PGS_Morphology.getGroupShape()`, assuming that `PGS_Morphology` is a class that has a static method called `getGroupShape()` that returns a `PShape` object.
* I qualified the `assertEquals` and `assumeTrue` methods with their respective classes, `org.junit.Assert` and `org.junit.Assume`, to avoid any potential naming conflicts.

Note that this patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class has a static method called `getGroupShape()` that returns a `PShape` object, and that the original `GROUP_SHAPE` variable was referring to this object. If this assumption is incorrect, then the patch may not work as expected.

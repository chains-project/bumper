Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_buffer() {
    assumeTrue(PApplet.groupCount(GROUP_SHAPE) == 2);
    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.buffer(GROUP_SHAPE, -1);
    assertEquals(2, PApplet.groupCount(out));
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the method `getChildCount()` with `groupCount()`, which is a method in the `PApplet` class that returns the number of child shapes in a `PShape` object. I also added the `PApplet` prefix to the method calls to avoid ambiguity. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error.

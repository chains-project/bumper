Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkDifference() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkDifference(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("minkDifference returned null");
    }
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added an import statement for the `PShape` class and the `CLOSE` constant.
* I added a null check for the `out` variable before calling `getChildCount()`. If `minkDifference` returns null, the test will fail with a helpful error message.

Note that these changes do not necessarily fix the underlying issue with the external dependency. However, they make the client code more robust and able to handle potential failures gracefully.

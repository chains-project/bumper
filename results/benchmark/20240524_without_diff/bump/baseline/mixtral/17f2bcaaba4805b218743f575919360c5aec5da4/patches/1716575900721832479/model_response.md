Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(condition);
```
In this patch, we remove the static import statement and replace it with an import statement for the `Assume` class. We then use the `assumeTrue` method by qualifying it with the `Assume` class name. This should fix the error message about static imports only from classes and interfaces.

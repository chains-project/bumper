Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;
import static processing.core.PConstants.CLOSE;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_minkSum() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape mink = new PShape(PShape.PATH);
    mink.beginShape();
    mink.vertex(0, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 0);
    mink.vertex(5, 5);
    mink.vertex(0, 5);
    mink.endShape(CLOSE);

    PShape out = PGS_Morphology.minkSum(GROUP_SHAPE, mink);
    if (out != null) {
        assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
    } else {
        fail("Expected a non-null result.");
    }
}
```

In this patch, I added a null check for the `out` variable before calling `assertEquals`. This is because the error message suggests that the symbol cannot be found, which might mean that `out` is null. Adding the null check ensures that the code does not try to access a method on a null object, which could cause a NullPointerException.

Note that I did not introduce any new library methods, so there are no `++` annotations. I also did not remove any library methods, so there are no `--` annotations.

Finally, I made sure to keep the function signature unchanged, as required.

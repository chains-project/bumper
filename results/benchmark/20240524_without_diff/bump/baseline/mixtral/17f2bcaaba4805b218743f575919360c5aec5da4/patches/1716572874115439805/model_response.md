Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_erosionDilation() {
    assumeTrue(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape out = Morphology.erosionDilation(Morphology.GROUP_SHAPE, 0);
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology` class or object has been removed or renamed, and has been replaced by a new `Morphology` class or object. The `GROUP_SHAPE` field has also been moved to this new `Morphology` class or object.

Note that this patch is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the error depending on the specific changes in the external dependency.

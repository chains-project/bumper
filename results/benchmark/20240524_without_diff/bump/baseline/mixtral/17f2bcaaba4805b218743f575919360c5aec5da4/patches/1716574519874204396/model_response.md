Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import processing.core.PShape;

@Test
void test_PGS_Morphology_round() {
    assumeTrue(GROUP_SHAPE.getChildCount() == 2);
    PShape roundShape = PGS_Morphology.round(GROUP_SHAPE, 0.5);
    PShape out = (PShape) roundShape.getChild(0); // assuming the first child is the result
    assertEquals(2, out.getChildCount());
}
```

This patch assumes that the `PGS_Morphology.round` method returns a `PShape` object that contains the result as its first child. If the result is located in a different child or if the result is not a `PShape` object, the patch may not work as expected.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.Assume;

// ...

Assume.assumeTrue(/* condition */);
```
In this patch, we replace the static import statement with an import statement for the `Assume` class. We then use the `Assume` class directly, instead of using its static method through a static import. This should fix the error message, which complains about a static import from a non-class or non-interface.

Note that we assume that the condition used in the original code is still valid and can be passed as an argument to the `assumeTrue` method. If this is not the case, the code may still fail, but for a different reason.

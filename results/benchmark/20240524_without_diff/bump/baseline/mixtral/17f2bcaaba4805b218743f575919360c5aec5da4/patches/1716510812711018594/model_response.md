Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.JUnit4;

@RunWith(JUnit4.class)
@Ignore
public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    // existing test methods
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `Ignore` class cannot be found in the `org.junit` package. This suggests that the `Ignore` annotation is not being recognized by the new version of the library.

To fix this, we can replace the `Ignore` annotation with the `@RunWith` and `@Ignore` annotations from the `org.junit.runner.RunWith` and `org.junit.runners.JUnit4` packages, respectively. This should ensure that the tests are still ignored, while avoiding the use of the `Ignore` class.

Note that the `@Override` decorator has been removed from the `FastPolygonizerTests` class, as it is not overriding any methods in the new version of the library.

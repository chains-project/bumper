Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = true; // new variable
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The only change made is the addition of a new boolean variable `startsWith` set to `true`, which is then passed as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This is based on the error message, which indicates that the first argument of the `StringStartsWith` constructor should be a string, not a boolean. By setting the boolean to `true`, it should have no effect on the functionality of the code.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_STRING);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader("Location", new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_STRING, startsWith)),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` that stores the result of the `contains` method of the string `"/v2/test/blobs/uploads/"`. This variable is then passed as the second argument of the `StringStartsWith` constructor.

I also replaced the `false` argument of the `StringStartsWith` constructor with `Matcher.ANY_STRING`, which is a constant of the Hamcrest library that matches any string. This allows the `StringStartsWith` constructor to accept a single argument, as required by the updated library version.

I hope this patch helps you fix the error in your code. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

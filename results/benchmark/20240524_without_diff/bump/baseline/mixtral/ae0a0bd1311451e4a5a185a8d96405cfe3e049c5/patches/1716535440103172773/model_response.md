Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In the original code, the `StringContains` constructor was being called with two arguments, but the constructor only accepts one argument. In the updated code, I've changed the constructor call to only include one argument, which should resolve the compilation error.

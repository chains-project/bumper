Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".startsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` to store the boolean value `/v2/test/blobs/uploads/`.startsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")`, which is always true. Then, I passed this variable as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor, instead of passing the boolean literal `false`. This way, the `StringStartsWith` constructor can accept the given types and the code can compile successfully.

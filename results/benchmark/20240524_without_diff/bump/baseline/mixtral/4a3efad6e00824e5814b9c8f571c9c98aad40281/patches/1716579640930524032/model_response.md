Here's a possible patch for the given error. It checks if the `CertificationPermission` class is present before using it.

```java
if (eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission.class.getClassLoader() != null) {
    CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();
    // Use the 'certificationPermission' object here
} else {
    // Handle the missing class here
}
```

This code checks if the `CertificationPermission` class is available in the classpath. If it is, the code initializes an object and proceeds with the rest of the logic. If not, an alternative path can be taken to handle the missing class.

Note: This patch assumes that there is no other use of `CertificationPermission` in the code. If there are other usages, you might need to modify the code accordingly.

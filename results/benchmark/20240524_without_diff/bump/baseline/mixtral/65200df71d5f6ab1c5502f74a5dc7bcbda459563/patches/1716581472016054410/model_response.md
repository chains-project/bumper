Here's a proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    PropertyAccessor propertyAccessor = new PropertyAccessor();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .addEnabledLanguages(propertyAccessor.getEnabledLanguages())
            .setClientPid(propertyAccessor.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(propertyAccessor.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(propertyAccessor.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(propertyAccessor.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```

Assuming that `globalConfig` was previously used to access properties, this patch introduces a new `PropertyAccessor` class that will be responsible for accessing these properties.

Note: This solution assumes that there's a `PropertyAccessor` class available that provides methods for accessing the required properties. If not, you need to implement the `PropertyAccessor` class with proper methods to access the required properties.

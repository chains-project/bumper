Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which was added in the new library version. I also added the `@Loggable` annotation to enable logging for the `RegionITCase` class. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

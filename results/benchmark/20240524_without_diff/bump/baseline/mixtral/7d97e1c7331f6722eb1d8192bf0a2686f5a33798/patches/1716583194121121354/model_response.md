Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found, which is part of the `jcabi-aspects` library. It's possible that this library has been removed or updated, and the `Tv` aspect is no longer available.

To fix the error, we can replace the use of `Tv` with a different aspect that achieves a similar goal. In this case, we can use the `Immutable` aspect, which ensures that the annotated class cannot be modified after construction.

Note that the `Immutable` aspect is part of the same `jcabi-aspects` library, so it should be available in the project's classpath. If it's not, you may need to update the project's dependencies to include the latest version of the library.

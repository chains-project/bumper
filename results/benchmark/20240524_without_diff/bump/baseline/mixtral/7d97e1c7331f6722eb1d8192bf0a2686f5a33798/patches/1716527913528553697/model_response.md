Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which was added in the new library version. The `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to `Tv`, as it allows you to log method execution. I also added the `@Loggable` annotation with the `Loggable.DEBUG` parameter to enable debug logging for the methods in the `RegionITCase` class.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. The `Tv` aspect is no longer available in the updated dependency, but the `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality and can be used as a replacement.

Note that the `Tv` aspect was used to log the current time before and after each test method, so we've added a `Loggable` aspect with the `DEBUG` level to the `RegionITCase` class to preserve this behavior.

This patch should fix the "cannot find symbol" error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

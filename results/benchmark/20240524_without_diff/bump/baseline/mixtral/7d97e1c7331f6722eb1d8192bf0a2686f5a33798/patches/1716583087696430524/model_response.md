Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
   // existing code...
}
```
The original import statement was using the `Tv` aspect from the jcabi-aspects library. However, the error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found. Instead, I've replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a drop-in replacement for logging.

Note that the `Loggable` aspect has a different constructor signature than `Tv`, so any existing usage of `Tv` in the code will need to be updated accordingly. Additionally, the `Loggable` aspect has a different behavior than `Tv`, so the code may need to be updated to reflect this.

In this case, I've added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class with a log level of `DEBUG`. This will log all method calls and returns for the class at the `DEBUG` level. If you don't want to log all method calls, you can add the `@Loggable` annotation to individual methods instead.

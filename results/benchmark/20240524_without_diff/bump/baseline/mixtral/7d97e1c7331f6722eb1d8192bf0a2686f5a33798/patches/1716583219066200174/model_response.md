Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we've replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. The `Tv` aspect is no longer available in the updated dependency, so we've used the `Loggable` aspect instead. The `Tv` aspect was used for logging debug information, and the `Loggable` aspect can be used for the same purpose.

Note that the `@Loggable` annotation has been updated to use the `Loggable.DEBUG` level instead of the deprecated `Tv.Level.DEBUG` level.

Here's a potential patch for the given error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with `Loggable` from the same `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This is based on the assumption that `Tv` was removed and `Loggable` was added in the new library version.

Note that the `@Loggable` annotation is added with a value of `Loggable.DEBUG` to mimic the behavior of the `@Tv` annotation, assuming it provided some logging functionality. You may need to adjust the value of the `@Loggable` annotation based on the actual behavior of `@Tv`.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class RegionITCase {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. The `Tv` aspect was removed in newer versions of the jcabi-aspects library, and `Loggable` is a recommended alternative for logging.

Note that the `@Loggable` annotation may not be strictly necessary for fixing the compilation error, but it's included here to maintain the same level of functionality as the original code. You can remove it if it's not needed in your specific use case.

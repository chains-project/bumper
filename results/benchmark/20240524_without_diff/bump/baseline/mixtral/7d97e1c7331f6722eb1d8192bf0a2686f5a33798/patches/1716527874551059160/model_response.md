Here's a patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a more appropriate choice for logging purposes. The `Loggable` aspect is an alternative to the `Tv` aspect and provides similar functionality. The `@Loggable` annotation accepts a log level as a parameter, and in this case, I used the `Loggable.DEBUG` level.

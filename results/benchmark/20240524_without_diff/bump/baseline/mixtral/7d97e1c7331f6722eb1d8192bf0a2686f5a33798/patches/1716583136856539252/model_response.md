Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. This is because the `Tv` aspect is no longer available in the updated version of the library. Instead, we can use the `Loggable` aspect to log debug messages.

Note that the `Loggable` aspect has a different constructor than `Tv`, so any existing uses of `Tv` in the code will need to be updated accordingly. In this patch, I've added a `Loggable.DEBUG` argument to the `@Loggable` annotation to mimic the behavior of `Tv`. However, this may not be appropriate for all use cases, so you may need to adjust the argument accordingly.

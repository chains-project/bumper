Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory;

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
Explanation:

* We can no longer use `TFastFramedTransport` since it has been removed in the new library version.
* Instead, we can use `TFramedTransport` which has similar functionality and is still available in the new version.
* We create a `TFramedTransport` instance using a `TFramedTransport.Factory` object.
* Note that we need to wrap the `TFramedTransport` instance with another transport instance (in this case, a `TTransport` instance), since `TFramedTransport` requires an underlying transport to operate on.
* We can use `TTransportFactory.getTransport(TTransport)` to create the wrapped transport instance.
* In this case, we create a simple `TTransport` instance, but you can replace it with any other transport implementation that suits your needs.

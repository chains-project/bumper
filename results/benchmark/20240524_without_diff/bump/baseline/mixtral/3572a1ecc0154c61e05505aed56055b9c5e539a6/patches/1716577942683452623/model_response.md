Here is a possible patch for the given code:
```java
  @Override
  public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
    TProtocolFactory protocolFactory = new TBinaryProtocol.Factory();
    framedTransport = (TFramedTransport) transport;
    protocol = protocolFactory.getProtocol(transport);
  }
```
In this patch, I created a `TTransport` variable to hold the `TFramedTransport` instance, and a `TProtocolFactory` variable to create the `TBinaryProtocol` instance. This way, the code uses only the available classes in the current version of the library.

I also casted the `transport` variable to `TFramedTransport` when assigning it to `framedTransport`, because the `framedTransport` variable is declared as `TFramedTransport`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `framedTransport` and `protocol` variables are declared as follows:
```java
private TFramedTransport framedTransport;
private TProtocol protocol;
```
If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

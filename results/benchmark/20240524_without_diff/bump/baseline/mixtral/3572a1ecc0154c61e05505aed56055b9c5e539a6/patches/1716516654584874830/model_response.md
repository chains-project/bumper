Here is a patch that you can apply to the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory;

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
This code creates a new `TFramedTransport` object using the `TFramedTransport.Factory` class, which is a new addition in the updated library. The `getTransport` method is used to create a new `TTransport` object, which can be used in place of the `TFastFramedTransport` object.

Note that I had to add the import statements for `TFramedTransport` and `TTransportFactory` in order for the code to compile.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method in `AppenderUtils.java`. This patch replaces the failing import statement and removes the usage of the `TFastFramedTransport` class.

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

// ...

public static void configureFastFramedTransport(TTransport transport) {
    if (transport instanceof TFramedTransport) {
        TFramedTransport framedTransport = (TFramedTransport) transport;
        framedTransport.setFrameSize(16 * 1024);
    }
}
```

This patch replaces the `TFastFramedTransport` import with `TFramedTransport` and removes the `setLatency` method call, which is specific to the `TFastFramedTransport` class. Since the `setFrameSize` method is present in both `TFastFramedTransport` and `TFramedTransport`, this patch should work without causing any further issues.

Note: This patch assumes that the `TFramedTransport` class is available and included in the project's dependencies. If not, it should be added to the project.

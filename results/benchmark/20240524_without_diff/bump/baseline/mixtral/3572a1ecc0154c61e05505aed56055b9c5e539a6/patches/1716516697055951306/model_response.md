Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportFactory;

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport.Factory().getTransport(new TTransport());
```
In this patch, we are using the new `TFramedTransport.Factory` class introduced in the new library version to create a `TFramedTransport` object. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error you were seeing before.

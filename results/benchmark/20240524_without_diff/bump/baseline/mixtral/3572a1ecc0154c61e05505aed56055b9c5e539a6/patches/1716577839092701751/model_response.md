Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
  this.os = os;
  // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
  // log.
  final int bufferCapacity = 10;
  TTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(os);
  TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
  TProtocol protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
  framedTransport.open();
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class, which is a part of the Thrift library and should be available in the newer version. I've also added a call to `framedTransport.open()` to ensure that the transport is properly initialized.

Note that I've assumed that the `os` variable is of type `OutputStream` and that it's passed as a parameter to the `init` method. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know and I'll update the patch accordingly.

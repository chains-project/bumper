Here's a possible patch for the given code. It seems like the issue is caused by the missing class `TFastFramedTransport`, so I replaced its usage with `TFramedTransport`, which should be available in the newer version of the library.

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
  this.os = os;
  // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
  // log.
  final int bufferCapacity = 10;
  framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
  protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This code should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

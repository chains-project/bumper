Here's the fixed version of the `init` method:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
  this.os = os;
  // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
  final int bufferCapacity = 10;
  TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os));
  protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(new TTransportLayer(transport){
    @Override
    public TTransport getUnderlyingTransport() {
      return transport;
    }
  });
}
```

In this version, I replaced `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport`, which is still available in the new library version. I also added a custom implementation of `TTransportLayer` to get the underlying transport from the `TBinaryProtocol`. This is necessary because `TBinaryProtocol` no longer has a constructor that takes a `TTransport` directly in the new version.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

// ...

public static TFramedTransport createFramedTransport(TTransport transport) {
  if (transport instanceof TNonblockingTransport) {
    return new TFastFramedTransport((TNonblockingTransport) transport);
  } else {
    return new TFramedTransport(transport);
  }
}
```

In this patch, I replaced `TFastFramedTransport` with `TFramedTransport` since the latter is a more generic class and should work with both `TNonblockingTransport` and other types of `TTransport`. Additionally, I added a check to determine if the `transport` instance is a `TNonblockingTransport`, and if so, create a `TFastFramedTransport` instance, otherwise, create a `TFramedTransport` instance. This way, the code should be compatible with both old and new versions of the external dependency.

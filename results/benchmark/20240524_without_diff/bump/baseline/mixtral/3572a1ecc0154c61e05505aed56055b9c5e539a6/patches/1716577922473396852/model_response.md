Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
  this.os = os;
  // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
  // log.
  final int bufferCapacity = 10;
  TTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(os);
  TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
  protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `TFlushingFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class, which should still be available in the external dependency. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error. Additionally, I created a separate variable for the `TIOStreamTransport` instance, which is then passed to the `TFramedTransport` constructor. This makes the code a bit cleaner and easier to read.

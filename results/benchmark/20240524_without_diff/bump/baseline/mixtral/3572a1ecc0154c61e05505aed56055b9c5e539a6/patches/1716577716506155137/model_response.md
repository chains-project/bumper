Here's a possible patch for the given failing code. This patch replaces the problematic import statement with an import for a different class in the same package. It's possible that this replacement class provides similar functionality to the original class, or that the functionality is not needed in the first place.
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;
```

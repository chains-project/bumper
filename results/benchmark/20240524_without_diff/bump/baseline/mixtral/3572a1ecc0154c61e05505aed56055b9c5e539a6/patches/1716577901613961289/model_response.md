Here's a potential patch for the given code. It replaces the usage of the `TFastFramedTransport` class with the `TFramedTransport` class, which should be available in the same external dependency.

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
  this.os = os;
  // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
  // log.
  final int bufferCapacity = 10;
  framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os), bufferCapacity);
  protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

This patch should fix the error by using a class that is still present in the external dependency.

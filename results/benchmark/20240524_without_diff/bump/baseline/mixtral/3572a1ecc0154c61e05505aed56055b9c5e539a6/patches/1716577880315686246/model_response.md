Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
  this.os = os;
  // Use the TFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
  // log.
  final int bufferCapacity = 10;
  TTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(os);
  TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
  protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

In this patch, I removed the `TFlushingFastFramedTransport` class, which may have been removed from the external dependency. Instead, I used the `TFramedTransport` class, which should still be available. I also created a `TTransport` variable `transport` to simplify the initialization of `framedTransport`.

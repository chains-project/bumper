Here's the proposed patch for the given failing code:

```java
import static org.deeplearning4j.nn.api.ActivationFunction.SIGMOID;
```

This patch imports the `sigmoid` function from the updated `deeplearning4j` library, which should replace the original `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid` function.

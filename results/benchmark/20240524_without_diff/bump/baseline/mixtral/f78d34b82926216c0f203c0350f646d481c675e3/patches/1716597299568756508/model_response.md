Here is a potential patch for the code:
```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

/**
 * ReLU関数で値を強めて出力系に入れる。
 *
 * @param inputData InputクラスのArrayListデータ。
 */
public void input(ArrayList<Input> inputData)
{
    IntStream.range(0, inputData.size()).forEach(i -> setValue(sigmoid(sum + inputData.get(i).getWeightingValue())));
}
```
This patch uses an `IntStream` to iterate over the indices of the `inputData` list, and then uses these indices to access the elements of the list. It then passes the weighting value of each input to the `sigmoid` function and adds it to the `sum` variable.

Note that this patch assumes that the `sum` variable is initialized appropriately before the `input` method is called. If this is not the case, you may need to initialize `sum` to 0 at the beginning of the method.

Additionally, this patch removes the `parallelStream` and `forEachOrdered` methods, as they are not necessary for this particular implementation and may have been causing the "cannot find symbol" error. If you need to maintain the parallelism of the original code, you may need to modify this patch accordingly.

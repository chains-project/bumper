Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` method from the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision` class, which is an alternative to the original library method from `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath`. Note that the `sigmoid` method has the same signature in both libraries, so the rest of the client code should work as expected.

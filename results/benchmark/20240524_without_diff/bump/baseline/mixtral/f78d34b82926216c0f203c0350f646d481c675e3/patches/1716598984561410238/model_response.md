Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import static ml.peya.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```

This patch updates the import statement to use the correct package name for the `LearnMath` class. Based on the error message, the `develop.p2p.lib` package does not exist, so the import statement needs to be updated to use the correct package name. In this case, the correct package name appears to be `ml.peya.lib`.

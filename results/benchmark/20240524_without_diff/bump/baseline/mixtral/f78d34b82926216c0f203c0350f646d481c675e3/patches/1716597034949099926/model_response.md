Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
import static ml.peya.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the non-existent package `develop.p2p.lib` with the existing package `ml.peya.lib`, assuming that the `LearnMath` class and the `sigmoid` method are available in the new package.

Here is a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.ml.distance.EuclideanDistance;

double sigmoid(double x) {
    return 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-x));
}
```
Explanation:

* I replaced the non-existent package `develop.p2p.lib` with `org.apache.commons.math3.ml.distance`, which contains a method called `EuclideanDistance` that can be used to calculate the distance between two points in a multidimensional space.
* I defined a new `sigmoid` function that calculates the sigmoid of a given number using the standard formula: `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.

Note: I am assuming that the `sigmoid` function was originally intended to calculate the sigmoid of a given number. If this is not the case, please provide more context about the purpose of the `sigmoid` function so I can propose a more accurate patch.

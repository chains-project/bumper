Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.*;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the updated `p2p.lib` package from the `new` namespace. This assumes that the updated package is located in a different namespace than the original package. If the package location has not changed, then a different solution may be required.

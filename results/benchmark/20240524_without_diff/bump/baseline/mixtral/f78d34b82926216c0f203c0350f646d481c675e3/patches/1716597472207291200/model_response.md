Here's a proposed patch for the given client code:
```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

//...

public void input(ArrayList<Input> inputData)
{
    IntStream.range(0, inputData.size()).parallel().forEach(i -> input(inputData.get(i).getWeightingValue()));
    setValue(sigmoid(sum));
}
```
The patch converts the `parallelStream()` method to a regular `IntStream` using `IntStream.range(0, inputData.size())`. Then, the `forEach` method is used with an index `i` to access each element of the `inputData` ArrayList. This avoids the use of the external dependency causing the failure.

Note: The `parallelStream()` method is not recommended for parallel processing of collections with sequential side-effects, such as the `forEachOrdered` method in the original code. It's better to use the `IntStream.range()` method for parallel processing of integer sequences.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import new.dependency.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This patch assumes that the missing package `develop.p2p.lib` has been replaced by a new package `new.dependency.lib` in the external dependency. The `WaveCreator` class has been assumed to be available in the new package. If the class has been removed or its name has changed, you will need to adjust the import statement accordingly.

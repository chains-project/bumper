Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import new.dependency.WaveCreator;
```

This patch imports the `WaveCreator` class from the new and updated package `new.dependency`. It's assumed that the `WaveCreator` class still exists and has the same functionality in the new package.

Note that this patch assumes that the `WaveCreator` class has not been removed or renamed in the new version of the external dependency. If it has, then a different solution would be needed.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import new.dependency.WaveCreator;
```

Note that I had to replace the `develop.p2p.lib` package with a new package name `new.dependency` since the original package does not exist. You will need to replace `new.dependency` with the actual package name of the updated dependency.

Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:

```java
import new.dependency.lib.*;
```

This assumes that the missing package `develop.p2p.lib` has been replaced with a new dependency `new.dependency.lib`. If the package name or the location of the new dependency is different, you may need to adjust the import statement accordingly.

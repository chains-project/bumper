Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with the new package name that should contain the required WaveCreator class. It's assumed that the WaveCreator class has been moved to the new package in the updated external dependency.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import new.dependency.lib.*;
```
This patch imports the new dependency that replaces `develop.p2p.lib`. The package name is assumed to be `new.dependency.lib`, but it may be different in your case. You need to replace it with the actual package name of the new dependency.

Note that this patch assumes that the new dependency provides compatible methods and classes with the same names and signatures as in `develop.p2p.lib`. If not, you may need to modify the client code to adapt to the changes in the new dependency.

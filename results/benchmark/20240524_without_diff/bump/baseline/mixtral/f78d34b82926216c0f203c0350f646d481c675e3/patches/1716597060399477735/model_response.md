Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import static org.apache.commons.math3.ml.stat.regression.Sigmoid.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the original import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` method from the `org.apache.commons.math3.ml.stat.regression.Sigmoid` class. This class is part of the Apache Commons Math library, which provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical components.

Note that the original `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid` method is not available in the new version, so we need to find an alternative implementation. The Apache Commons Math library provides a `sigmoid` method that can be used as a drop-in replacement.

Also note that the import statement uses the fully qualified class name, which includes the package name. This is because the `sigmoid` method is a static method, so we need to specify the full path to the method.

Finally, note that the patch only modifies the import statement, and does not change any other part of the code. This is because the method signature has not changed, so we can use the same method name and parameters as before.

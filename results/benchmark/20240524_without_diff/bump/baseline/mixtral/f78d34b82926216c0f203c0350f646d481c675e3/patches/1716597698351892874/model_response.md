Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import new.dependency.WaveCreator;
```

This patch imports the `WaveCreator` class from the new dependency instead of the old one. It's important to ensure that the new dependency includes the `WaveCreator` class and that it's compatible with the client code.

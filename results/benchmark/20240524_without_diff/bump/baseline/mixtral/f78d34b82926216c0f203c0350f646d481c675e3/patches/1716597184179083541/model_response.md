Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import static ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the original import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions` class, which is a part of the Deep Java Library (DJL) that provides a set of common deep learning functions.

Note that the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` package does not exist in the new version of the library, so we need to find an alternative way to import the `sigmoid` function.

Also, note that the original `sigmoid` function is still available in the new version of the library, but it has been moved to a different package, so we need to update our import statement accordingly.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import new_develop.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This patch imports the `WaveCreator` class from the updated package `new_develop.p2p.lib` instead of `develop.p2p.lib`. The package name was changed in the external dependency, and the client code needs to be updated accordingly.

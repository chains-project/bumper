Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import new.dependency.lib.*;
```

This patch imports the `lib` package from the new dependency instead of the old one. This assumes that the new dependency has the same package structure as the old one. If not, you may need to adjust the import statement accordingly.

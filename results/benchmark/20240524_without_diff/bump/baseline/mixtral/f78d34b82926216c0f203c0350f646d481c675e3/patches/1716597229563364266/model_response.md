Here is a possible patch for the code:
```java
import static ai.libs.math.function.special.sigmoid;
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.libs.math.function.special` package. This package is a likely replacement for the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class, as it contains a similar `sigmoid` function.

Note that this patch assumes that the `sigmoid` function in the new package has the same signature and behavior as the one in the old package. If this is not the case, the code may still fail to compile or produce incorrect results. It is always a good idea to thoroughly test the repaired code to ensure that it works correctly.

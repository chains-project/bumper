Here's a proposed patch for the given client code:

```java
import static ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the import statement of the `sigmoid` function from the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` package to the `ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions` package, which should be available in the newer version of the external dependency.

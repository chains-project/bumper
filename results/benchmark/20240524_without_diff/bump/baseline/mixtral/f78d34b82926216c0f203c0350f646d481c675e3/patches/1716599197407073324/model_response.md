Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
import static your.new.dependency.LearnMath.sigmoid;
```

Assuming that the `sigmoid` function has been moved to a new dependency with the package name `your.new.dependency`. If the function has not been moved or renamed, then you may not need to change the import statement at all.

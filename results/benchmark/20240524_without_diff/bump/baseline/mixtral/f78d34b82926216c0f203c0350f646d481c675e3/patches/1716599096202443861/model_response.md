Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static ai.djl.basicmath.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.basicmath` package, which is a likely replacement for the missing `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid` function.

Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import static ai.libs.math.function.special.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the original import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the updated `ai.libs.math.function.special` package. The `develop.p2p.lib` package has been removed and replaced with `ai.libs.math.function.special` in the updated version.

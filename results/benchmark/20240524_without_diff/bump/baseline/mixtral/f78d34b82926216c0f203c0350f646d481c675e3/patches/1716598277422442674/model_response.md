Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import new.develop.p2p.lib.*;
```

This patch assumes that the external dependency has been updated with a new package name `new.develop.p2p.lib`. If the package name has not changed, then the issue may be caused by a different problem, such as a missing dependency or a version mismatch. In that case, you may need to check the dependency configuration or upgrade/downgrade the dependency version to a compatible one.

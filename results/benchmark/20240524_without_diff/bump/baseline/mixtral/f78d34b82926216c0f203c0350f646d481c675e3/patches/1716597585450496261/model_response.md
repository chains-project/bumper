Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This patch assumes that the missing package `develop.p2p.lib` has been replaced with a new package `new.p2p.lib` in the external dependency. The `WaveCreator` class is assumed to be available in the new package.

Note that this patch assumes that there are no breaking changes in the `WaveCreator` class between the old and new versions. If there are any breaking changes, additional changes may be necessary to make the code compile and work correctly.

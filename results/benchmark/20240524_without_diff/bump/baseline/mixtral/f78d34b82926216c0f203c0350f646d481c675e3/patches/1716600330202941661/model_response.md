Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.*;
```

Note that I replaced `develop` with `new` as a placeholder for the actual updated package name of the external dependency. You'll need to replace `new` with the actual updated package name. Also, make sure that the updated package contains the same classes and methods as the old one, or modify the code accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
import new.p2p.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This patch assumes that the `develop.p2p.lib` package has been updated to a new package name `new.p2p.lib`.

Note that the package name is the only thing that has changed, the class name `WaveCreator` remains the same. This is because the error message indicates that the package does not exist, rather than a class within the package.

This patch will allow the client code to compile again, but it may still be necessary to check that the updated package provides the same functionality as the previous one.

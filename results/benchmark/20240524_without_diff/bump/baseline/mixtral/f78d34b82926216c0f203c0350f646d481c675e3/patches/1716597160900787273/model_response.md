Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import static ai.djl.ndarray.functions.MathFunctions.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the original import statement with a new one that imports the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.ndarray.functions` package. This package is a part of the Deep Java Library (DJL) and provides a wide range of mathematical functions, including the sigmoid function. This patch assumes that the DJL library is available in the project's classpath.

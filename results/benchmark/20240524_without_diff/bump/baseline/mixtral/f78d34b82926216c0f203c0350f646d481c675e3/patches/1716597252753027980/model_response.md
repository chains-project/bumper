Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import static ai.djl.basicmath.BasicMathFunctions.sigmoid;
```

This patch replaces the original import statement with a new one that uses the `sigmoid` function from the `ai.djl.basicmath` package, which is an alternative to the original `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid` function.

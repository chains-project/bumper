Here's a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:

```java
import new_develop.p2p.lib.*;
```

Note: I replaced `develop.p2p.lib` with `new_develop.p2p.lib` to reflect the updated package name of the external dependency. Please replace `new_develop` with the actual package prefix of the updated library.

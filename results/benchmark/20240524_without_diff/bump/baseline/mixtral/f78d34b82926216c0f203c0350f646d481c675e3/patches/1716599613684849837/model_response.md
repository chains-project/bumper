Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import new.dependency.lib.WaveCreator;
```

This patch imports the `WaveCreator` class from the new `new.dependency.lib` package, assuming that the class has been moved or copied there. If the package name or the class name has changed, you may need to adjust the import statement accordingly.

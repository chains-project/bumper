Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import new.p2p.lib.*;
```
This patch assumes that the failed package `develop.p2p.lib` has been updated to a new package `new.p2p.lib`.
The import statement has been changed accordingly.
This patch assumes that the new package has the same classes and methods as the old one.
If this is not the case, further modifications might be needed.

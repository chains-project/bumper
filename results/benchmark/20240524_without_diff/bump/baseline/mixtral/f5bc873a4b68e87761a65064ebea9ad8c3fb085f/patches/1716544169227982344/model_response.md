Here's a possible patch for the failing method in the client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.resolver.ArtifactResolverException;
import org.apache.maven.artifact.resolver.ArtifactResolver;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;
import org.codehaus.plexus.util.FileUtils;

// ...

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
    try {
        ArtifactResolver resolver = resolverProvider.getArtifactResolver();
        Artifact artifact = new DefaultArtifact(groupId, artifactId, version, Artifact.SCOPE_RUNTIME, "jar");
        Set<Artifact> artifacts = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        artifacts.add(artifact);
        CollectionRequest request = new CollectionRequest();
        request.setArtifacts(artifacts);
        request.setRepositories(getRepositories());
        request.setResolveTransitively(false);
        ArtifactResult result = resolver.resolve(request);
        File file = result.getArtifact().getFile();
        if (file.exists()) {
            File destDir = new File(basedir, "target/unpack/" + artifactId);
            FileUtils.copyDirectoryStructure(file.getParentFile(), destDir);
        }
    } catch (ArtifactResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to unpack theme: " + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
```

The patch includes the addition of the `ArtifactResolver` and `ArtifactResolverException` imports, as well as the creation of the `Artifact`, `CollectionRequest`, `ArtifactResult`, and `FileUtils` variables. The method signature remains unchanged, and no removed library methods are used. Instead, the `ArtifactResolver` is used to resolve the `Artifact` and copy its contents to the target directory.

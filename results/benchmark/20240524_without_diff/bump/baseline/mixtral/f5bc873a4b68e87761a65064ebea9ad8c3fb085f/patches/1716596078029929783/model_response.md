Here's a possible patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.plugins.annotations.Mojo;

@Mojo(name = "compile")
public class AbstractThemeMojo {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we removed the failing import statement and replaced the `@Override` annotation with `@Mojo(name = "compile")`.

Note: This patch assumes that the original code was trying to use the `DirectoryScanner` class from the `plexus-io` library as a superclass or interface, but the actual error is caused by an incorrect `@Override` annotation. The `@Mojo` annotation is a commonly used alternative for annotating Maven plugins.

Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image),
        "Downloaded newer image for"
    );
}
```

In this patch, we added a third argument `"Downloaded newer image for"` to the `StringContains` constructor. This argument is a substring that the `StringContains` matcher will look for within the inspected string. By doing this, we are ensuring that the `StringContains` constructor is called with the correct number and types of arguments, which should fix the error.

Note that the `StringContains` constructor with three arguments was added in Hamcrest version 1.3, so if you are using an earlier version of Hamcrest, this patch may not work. In that case, you may need to upgrade to a newer version of Hamcrest or use a different matcher.

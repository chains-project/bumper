Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    final boolean pushed = "Pushed";
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains(pushed));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In the original code, the `StringContains` constructor was called with two arguments, a boolean and a string. However, the updated library version only accepts a single string argument. To fix this, I've created a new variable `pushed` and passed it as an argument to the `StringContains` constructor. This ensures that the code is compatible with the updated library version.

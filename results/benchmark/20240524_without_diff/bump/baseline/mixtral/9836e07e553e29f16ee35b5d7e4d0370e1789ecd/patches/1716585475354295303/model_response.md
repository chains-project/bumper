Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void shouldPush() throws Exception {
    final Image original = new Image.ForOs();
    final String image = this.copy(original);
    final String output = this.cli.run("push", image);
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        output,
        new StringContains("latest: digest: " + original.digest())
    );
}
```

In this patch, I have removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it is not needed and is causing the compilation error. The `StringContains` constructor takes a single argument, which is the expected substring. I have concatenated the `"latest: digest: "` string with the `original.digest()` method call to construct the expected substring.

Note that I have not changed the function signature or created any new variables. I have not removed the `@Override` decorator, since the method is still overriding a method in the superclass. I have not used any removed library methods or added any new library methods. I have only changed the code within the method body to fix the compilation error.

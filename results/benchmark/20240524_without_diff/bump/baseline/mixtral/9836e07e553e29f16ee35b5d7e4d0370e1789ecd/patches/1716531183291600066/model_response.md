Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    boolean pushed = false;
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        pushed = output.contains("Pushed");
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(pushed, Matchers.is(true));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `pushed` to store the result of checking if the output contains the string "Pushed". Then, I used the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` method to check if the value of `pushed` is true. This way, we can avoid the error caused by the updated library version.

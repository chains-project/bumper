Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private Matcher<String> manifestPushed() {
    String digest = this.image.digest();
    return new StringContains(String.format("latest: digest: %s", digest));
}
```

This patch creates a temporary variable `digest` for the digest string, and removes the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, which was causing the compilation error.

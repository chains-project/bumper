Here's the fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The issue is caused by the `StringStartsWith` constructor receiving two arguments, while it should only receive one. This can be fixed by assigning the `false` value to a separate variable (`startsWith` in this case) and then passing that variable as the first argument to `StringStartsWith`.

Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```
The only change I made is in the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` line. I removed the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, as it is not needed and is causing the error. With this change, the code should be able to compile and run with the new library version.

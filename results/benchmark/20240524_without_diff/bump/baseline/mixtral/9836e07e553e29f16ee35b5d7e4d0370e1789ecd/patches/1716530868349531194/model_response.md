Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I created a new variable `startsWith` to replace the boolean argument in the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This is because the `StringStartsWith` constructor no longer accepts a boolean argument in the new library version. Instead, I used `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` to match any character. This is an added method identified with `++`.

Note that this patch assumes that the original intent of the boolean argument was to match any character. If that's not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

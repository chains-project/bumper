Here is the proposed patch:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    String msg = String.format("Downloaded newer image for %s", image);
    return CoreMatchers.<String>containsString(msg);
}
```

This patch should fix the error by removing the unnecessary inner `<String>` in the `containsString` method call. It also declares a separate variable `msg` for the formatted string to improve readability.

Here is a possible patch for the given code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new CoreMatchers.containsString(
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    );
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the constructor `StringContains` in class `org.hamcrest.core.StringContains` cannot be applied to the given type. This suggests that the `StringContains` class or constructor may have been removed or changed in the external dependency.

To fix the error, we can use an alternative way to create a matcher that checks if a string contains a substring. In this case, we can use the `containsString` method from the `CoreMatchers` class, which is part of the Hamcrest library and provides various matchers for testing.

The `CoreMatchers.containsString` method takes a string argument and returns a matcher that matches if the actual value contains the specified substring. This method can be used as a replacement for the `StringContains` constructor, and it should work with the same arguments and behavior.

Note that the `CoreMatchers` class is part of the Hamcrest library, which is an external dependency that is used by JUnit and other testing frameworks. The `CoreMatchers` class is not part of the Java standard library, but it is a widely used and stable library that should be available in most Java environments.

Therefore, the proposed patch replaces the `StringContains` constructor with the `CoreMatchers.containsString` method, and it should fix the error caused by the dependency update.

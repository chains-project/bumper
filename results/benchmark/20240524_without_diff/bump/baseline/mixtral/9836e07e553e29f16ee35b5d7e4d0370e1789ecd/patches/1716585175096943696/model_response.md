Here's a possible patch for the failing method:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    );
}
```

The patch removes the `Status:` prefix from the expected string, which seems to be causing the type mismatch error. This assumes that the external dependency update didn't change the format of the actual log message.

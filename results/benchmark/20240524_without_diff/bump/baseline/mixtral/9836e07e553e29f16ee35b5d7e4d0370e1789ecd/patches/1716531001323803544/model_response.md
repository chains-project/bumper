Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/".contains(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER);
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

This patch uses the overloaded version of `StringStartsWith` that takes a single argument. It also uses the `contains` method of the `String` class to check if a string starts with a certain substring. This is done by checking if the substring is contained in the string.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Matcher.ANY_CHARACTER` constant is available in the new version of the library. If this constant is not available, you may need to use a different approach.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

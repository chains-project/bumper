Here is the proposed patch:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new PatternMatcher(
        "Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image,
        Pattern.LITERAL
    );
}
```

This patch replaces the `StringContains` matcher with a `PatternMatcher` that uses a regular expression to match the desired string. The constructor for `PatternMatcher` takes a regular expression as its first argument and a flag indicating how the expression should be interpreted as its second argument. In this case, the flag `Pattern.LITERAL` is used to indicate that the regular expression should be treated as a literal string, with all special characters (such as the period in `.Downloaded`) having their usual meaning.

This patch should fix the error because the `StringContains` constructor is no longer being called with incompatible arguments. Instead, a different matcher is being used that is compatible with the arguments being passed to it.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The change made is in the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` line, where the `StringContains` constructor is now called with a single argument `"Pushed"`, instead of the previous `false, "Pushed"`. This resolves the error message about the constructor's argument lists differing in length.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the import statement for `Tv` with `Loggable` from the same package `com.jcabi.aspects`. The `Tv` class has been removed from the library, so we need to find an alternative class that achieves a similar functionality. In this case, `Loggable` can be used to log debug messages.

Note that the `@Loggable` annotation takes a parameter `Loggable.DEBUG`, which is equivalent to the `@Tv` annotation in the original code.

Additionally, I added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `MkGithub` class, which is similar to adding `@Tv` to the class in the original code.

This patch should fix the error caused by the missing `Tv` class and allow the code to compile with the new library version.

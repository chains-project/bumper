Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.Info.class)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. Based on the library changes, it seems that the `Tv` class has been removed.

To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` aspect with another aspect that is available in the new library version. In this case, I have chosen the `Loggable` aspect as a replacement. The `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect, as it allows you to log information about method calls.

Note that I have added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `MkGithub` class, specifying the `Loggable.Info` class as the log level. You can adjust the log level as needed.

By using the `Loggable` aspect instead of the `Tv` aspect, the client code should now compile and run successfully with the new library version.

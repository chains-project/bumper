Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(40)
public class MkGithub implements Github {
    // existing code
}
```

In this patch, we replace the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with `com.jcabi.github.Github`. This is because the `Tv` aspect is no longer needed, and we can use the `Github` interface directly.

We also remove the `import` statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and add the `@Tv(40)` annotation directly to the `MkGithub` class. This is because the `Tv` aspect is no longer available, and we need to specify the desired TV version directly in the code.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of the `MkGithub` class implementation is unchanged and still compatible with the new version of the library. If this is not the case, further modifications may be necessary.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

Looking at the library changes, we can see that the `Loggable` aspect has been added. We can use this aspect to replace the functionality of the `Tv` aspect.

To do this, we need to:

1. Import the `Loggable` aspect.
2. Add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, specifying the logging level as `DEBUG`.

With these changes, the `MkGithub` class should compile and run successfully with the new version of the library.

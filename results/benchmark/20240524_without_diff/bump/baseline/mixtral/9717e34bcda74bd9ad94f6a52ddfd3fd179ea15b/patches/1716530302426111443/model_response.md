Here's a suggested patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a replacement for the deprecated `Tv` aspect. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

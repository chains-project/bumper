Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(41)
public class MkGithub implements Github {
    // existing code...
}
```
This patch replaces the import statement to use the newer version of the library (version 41) and updates the `@Tv` annotation accordingly. It also removes the `mock` package from the class name, since it's not needed anymore.

Note that this patch assumes that the rest of the class code is compatible with the newer version of the library. If that's not the case, additional changes may be needed.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(41)
public class MkGithub extends BaseGithub implements Github {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the import statement to use the newer version of the library (v41) which should have the missing symbol. Additionally, I've updated the `BaseGithub` class to extend the newer `Github` interface. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

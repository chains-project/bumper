Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Github;

@Tv(40)
public class MkGithub extends com.jcabi.github.Github {
    public MkGithub(String token) {
        super(new URL("https://api.github.com"), new GitHub.TokenAuth(token));
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the import statement for the missing class with an import statement for its superclass `com.jcabi.github.Github`. It also adds a constructor that calls the superclass constructor with the required arguments. Note that the `@Tv` annotation has been preserved.

Note that this patch assumes that the missing class `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` is not used in the rest of the code. If it is, you may need to find a different solution.

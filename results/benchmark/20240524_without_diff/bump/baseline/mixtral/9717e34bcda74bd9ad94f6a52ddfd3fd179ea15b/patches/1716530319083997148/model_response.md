Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed in the new library version.

To fix the error, we can remove the import statement for the `Tv` class and instead import the `Loggable` aspect from the same package. The `Loggable` aspect can be used to log debug messages, similar to how the `Tv` aspect might have been used in the original code.

Note that we're also adding the `@Loggable` annotation to the `MkGithub` class with a log level of `DEBUG`. This will enable debug logging for the class. You may need to adjust the log level or remove the annotation entirely, depending on your specific use case.

Here's a possible patch for the given error. It introduces a new dependency on the Bouncy Castle library, which should provide the missing package.

Add the following Maven dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.69</version>
</dependency>
```
Then, replace the failing import statement with the following:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```
This should fix the missing package error.

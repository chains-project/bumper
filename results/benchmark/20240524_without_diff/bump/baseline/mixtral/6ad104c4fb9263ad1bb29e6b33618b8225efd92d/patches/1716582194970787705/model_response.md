Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsFatalAlert;
```

This patch updates the import statement to use the new package name for the `TlsFatalAlert` class. Based on the error message, it seems that the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package has been removed or renamed in the updated dependency, and the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved to the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package. By updating the import statement, the code should be able to compile and run successfully.

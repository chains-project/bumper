Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    // ...

    @Override
    public void decode(InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
        try {
            short alertDescription = in.read();
            throw new TlsFatalAlert(alertDescription);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle exception
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this patch, I have imported the `TlsFatalAlert` class from the updated library version. The constructor for `TlsFatalAlert` has changed, so I have updated the code to use the new constructor that takes a `short` argument. The `getAlertDescription()` method has been removed, so I have removed the line of code that called it. Instead, I have stored the `alertDescription` value in a local variable and passed it to the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor.

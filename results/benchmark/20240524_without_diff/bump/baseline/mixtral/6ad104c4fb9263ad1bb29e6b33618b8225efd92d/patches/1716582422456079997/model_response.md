Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.TlsCrypto;

TlsCrypto crypto = TlsCrypto.getDefault();
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new one that imports the `TlsCrypto` class from the `org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto` package. It then creates a new `TlsCrypto` object using the default constructor.

Note that this patch assumes that the functionality provided by the `TlsFatalAlert` class is not needed for your use case. If it is, you may need to find an alternative solution.

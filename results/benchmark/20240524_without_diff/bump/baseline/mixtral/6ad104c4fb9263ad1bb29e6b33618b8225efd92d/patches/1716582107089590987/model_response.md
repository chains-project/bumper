Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with the correct import statement for the Bouncy Castle TLS library. The `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package has been removed in newer versions of the library, and the `org.bouncycastle.tls` package should be used instead. This patch ensures that the `AlertDescription` class can be imported correctly and the code can be compiled successfully.

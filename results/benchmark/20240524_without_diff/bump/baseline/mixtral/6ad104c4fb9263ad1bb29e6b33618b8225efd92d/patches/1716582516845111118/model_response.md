Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.TlsCrypto;

// ...

private void decode(TlsCrypto crypto, InputStream input, ByteQueue output) throws IOException {
    // ...
    TlsFatalAlert fatalAlert = new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.decode(input));
    // ...
}
```

Note that the import statement has been changed to use `org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.TlsCrypto` instead of `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert`. This is because the `TlsFatalAlert` class has been moved to a different package in the updated version of the library.

Additionally, a new instance of `TlsFatalAlert` is created using the `AlertDescription.decode()` method instead of the `TlsFatalAlert(int)` constructor. This is because the constructor has been removed in the updated version of the library.

Finally, a new variable `crypto` of type `TlsCrypto` has been added to the method signature. This is because the `TlsCrypto` class is used in the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor instead of the `TlsContext` class, which was used in the original code.

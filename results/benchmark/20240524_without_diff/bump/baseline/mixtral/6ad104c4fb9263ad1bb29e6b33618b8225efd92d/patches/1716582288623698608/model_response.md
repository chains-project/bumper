Here's a possible patch for the failing code. I'm assuming that the missing package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` has been removed in the new version of the external dependency.

As an alternative, you can use the `JSSE` provider which is included in the JDK. Here's the updated code:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.security.KeyManagementException;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

@Override
public SSLEngine createSSLEngine() {
    SSLContext context = null;
    try {
        context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    try {
        context.init(null, null, null);
    } catch (KeyManagementException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
    return context.createSSLEngine();
}
```

This updated code creates an `SSLContext` instance using the `TLS` algorithm and initializes it with default values. Then, it creates an `SSLEngine` instance using the `SSLContext`. This code should work as a replacement for the failing code.

Note that this code uses the `JSSE` provider which is included in the JDK. If you still want to use the `BouncyCastle` provider, you will need to add it as a dependency and import the necessary packages.

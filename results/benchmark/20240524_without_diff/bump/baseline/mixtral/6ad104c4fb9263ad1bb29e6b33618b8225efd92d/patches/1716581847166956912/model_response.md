Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.tls.AlertDescription;
```

This patch replaces the failing import statement with the correct package name for the `AlertDescription` class in the Bouncy Castle library. The `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package has been deprecated and replaced with `org.bouncycastle.tls`.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.DataLengthException;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.InvalidCipherTextException;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.params.KeyParameter;
import org.bouncycastle.util.Arrays;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public byte[] decodeCiphertext(byte[] receivedMAC, byte[] additionalData, byte[] ciphertext)
        throws IOException {
    try {
        KeyParameter macKey = initRecordMAC(decryptCipher);

        byte[] calculatedMAC = PolyKeyCreator.create(macKey, additionalData, ciphertext);

        if (!Arrays.constantTimeAreEqual(calculatedMAC, receivedMAC)) {
            throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.bad_record_mac);
        }

        byte[] output = new byte[ciphertext.length];
        decryptCipher.processBytes(ciphertext, 0, ciphertext.length, output, 0);

        return output;
    } catch (DataLengthException | IllegalStateException | InvalidCipherTextException e) {
        throw new IOException("Failed to decrypt ciphertext", e);
    }
}
```

The main change is the addition of a try-catch block around the decryption code to handle potential exceptions that may be thrown during the decryption process. Specifically, the `DataLengthException`, `IllegalStateException`, and `InvalidCipherTextException` exceptions are caught and re-thrown as an `IOException`. This change allows the code to handle the exceptions gracefully and avoid the "cannot find symbol" error.

Note that the `SecureRandom` class is not used in this patch since it is not clear from the original code snippet how it is related to the decryption process. If it is indeed required for the decryption process, it should be added back to the code.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh {
  // existing code...
}
```

The patch imports the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. The `@Tv` annotation is retained, but it has been moved to the class level and includes the values `{1, 2, 3}`. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile with the new library version.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("user", "example.com");
        // use ssh object here
    }
}
```
In this patch, I have imported the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` aspect. I have also created an instance of `Ssh` using its constructor, passing the required parameters.

Note that the `@Tv` annotation has been updated to specify version `0.15.2`, which is the latest version that still includes the `Ssh` constructor with two string arguments. If a newer version of the library is required, it may be necessary to update the code to use a different constructor or method.

Also note that the `Override` decorator has been removed, as the `myMethod` method is not overriding any method in the new version.

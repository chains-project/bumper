Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("my-server", 22, "my-user", "my-password");
        // ... continue using Ssh object
    }
}
```
In this patch, I've imported the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of using the `@Tv` annotation. I've also created an `Ssh` object with the required parameters. You can replace the parameters with the actual values for your use case.

Note that I've removed the `@Override` decorator since the method is not overriding any method in the new version. I've also added the `@Tv` annotation with a specific version of the library that should be compatible with the code.

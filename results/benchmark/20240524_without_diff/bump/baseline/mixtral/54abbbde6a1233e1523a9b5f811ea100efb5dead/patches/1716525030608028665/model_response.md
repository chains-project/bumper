Here's the proposed patch for the given failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
  // ...
}
```

The `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. Instead, I have used the `Loggable` aspect, which has been added in the new version. This will allow you to log debug-level messages in a similar way to the original `Tv` class.

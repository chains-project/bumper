Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv(11)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...

    @Override
    public Ssh connect(String host, int port, String username, String password) {
        // use the new version of the Ssh.using() method
        return Ssh.using(host, port, username, password);
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we remove the direct import of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead use the `@Tv` annotation directly on the class. We also update the `connect` method to use the new version of the `Ssh.using()` method, which takes a `password` parameter directly instead of using a `Credentials` object.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Ssh` class and the `using()` method are still available in the updated version of the library. If this is not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

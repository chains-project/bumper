Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    private Ssh ssh;

    public MyClass() {
        this.ssh = new Ssh("my-ssh-server.com", 22);
    }

    // Rest of the class remains unchanged.
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the problematic import statement with the correct one for the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class. I also created a new instance variable `ssh` and initialized it in the constructor. Note that I used the version `0.15.2` for the `@Tv` annotation, but you should adjust it according to the version you are using.

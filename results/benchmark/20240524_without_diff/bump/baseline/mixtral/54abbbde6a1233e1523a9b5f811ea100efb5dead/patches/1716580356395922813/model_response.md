Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("user", "example.com");
        // continue with your code
    }
}
```
In this patch, I replaced the missing class `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with the concrete version of the library it belongs to, which is `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`. I also added the `@Tv` annotation to specify the version of the library to use.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and the actual patch may vary depending on the specific dependencies and use cases of your code.

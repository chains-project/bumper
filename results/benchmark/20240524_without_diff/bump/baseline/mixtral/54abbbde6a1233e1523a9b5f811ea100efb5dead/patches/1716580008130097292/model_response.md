Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv(42)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...

    public Ssh ssh(String host, String user, String password) {
        return new SshByPassword.Simple(host, user, password);
    }

    // existing code...
}
```
Note that I replaced the import statement to use `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. This is because the `SshByPassword` class seems to be part of the `jcabi-ssh` library, and the `Tv` aspect is not needed for this class to work.

Additionally, I added a dummy `@Tv` annotation to the class to satisfy the requirement of keeping the function signature unchanged. This annotation does not affect the functionality of the code.

Finally, I made sure to keep the `ssh` method signature unchanged and only modified the implementation to use the `Ssh` interface instead of a specific implementation. This allows the code to be more flexible and adaptable to changes in the external dependency.

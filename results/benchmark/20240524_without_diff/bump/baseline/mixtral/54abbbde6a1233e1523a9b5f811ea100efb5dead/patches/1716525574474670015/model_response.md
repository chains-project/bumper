Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class MyClass extends Ssh {
  // ...
}
```

The `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation has been removed from the library, so we need to remove it from the client code as well. Instead, we can add the `@Tv` annotation directly to the class declaration.

Note that this patch assumes that the `MyClass` class extends `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`, as suggested by the error message. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the patch accordingly.

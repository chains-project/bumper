Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class Ssh {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package cannot be found. This suggests that the `jcabi-aspects` library has been updated and the `Tv` class has been removed.

To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` class with another class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package that provides similar functionality. In this case, we can use the `Loggable` aspect to log debug messages.

We can remove the `Tv` import statement and add an import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. We can then annotate the `Ssh` class with the `@Loggable` annotation and set its value to `Loggable.DEBUG` to enable debug logging.

This patch should resolve the error and allow the code to compile with the updated library version.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("my-server", 22, "my-username", "my-password");
        // use ssh object here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* I replaced the import statement with a new one that imports the `Ssh` class from the `jcabi-ssh` library.
* I added a `Ssh` object as a local variable in the `myMethod` method.
* I initialized the `Ssh` object with the required parameters.
* I assumed that the `myMethod` method uses the `Ssh` object, so I left the rest of the method as it is.

Note:

* I assumed that the `jcabi-ssh` library version `0.15.2` is compatible with the client code.
* You may need to adjust the version number or the initialization parameters of the `Ssh` object according to your specific use case.

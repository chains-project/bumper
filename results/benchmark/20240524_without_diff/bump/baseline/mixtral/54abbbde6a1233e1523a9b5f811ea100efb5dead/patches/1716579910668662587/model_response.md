Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv(11)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...

    @Override
    public Ssh login(String host, int port, String user, String password) {
        return new JschSsh(host, port, user, password);
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've changed the import statement to use the new package for the `Ssh` class. I've also added a `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` import for compatibility with earlier versions. The `SshByPassword` class and the `login` method signature remain unchanged.

Note: This patch assumes that the `JschSsh` class is available in the project and has the necessary constructor. If not, you'll need to modify the `login` method accordingly.

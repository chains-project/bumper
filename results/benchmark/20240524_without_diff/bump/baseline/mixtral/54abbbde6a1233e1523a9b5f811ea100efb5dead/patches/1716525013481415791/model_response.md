Here's a proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public SshByPassword createSshConnection() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```
In this patch, I have imported the `SshByPassword` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package, instead of using the `Tv` aspect from `com.jcabi.aspects`. This is because the `Tv` aspect seems to have been removed in the new library version.

I have also added the `@Tv` annotation to the `createSshConnection()` method, which should replicate the behavior of the `Tv` aspect.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` aspect was only used to annotate the `createSshConnection()` method, and that it did not have any other dependencies on the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. If this is not the case, then additional changes may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch for the error you're encountering:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"1.0"})
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...

    @Override
    public Ssh ssh(String host, int port, String username, String password) {
        // existing code...

        // replace the failing line with the following:
        Session session = jsch.getSession(username, host, port);

        // existing code...
    }

    // existing code...
}
```

In the patch above, we're replacing the failing line of code with a new line that uses the `jsch` object to get a `Session` object instead of using the `com.jcabi.ssh.SSHFactory` class. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error you're encountering.

Note that this patch assumes that the `jsch` object has already been initialized and configured properly. If that's not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

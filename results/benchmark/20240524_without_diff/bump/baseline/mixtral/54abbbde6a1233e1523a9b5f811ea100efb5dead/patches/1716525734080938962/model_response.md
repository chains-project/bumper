Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `Tv` class is not found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

To fix the error, we need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality without using the `Tv` class.

Looking at the library changes, we can see that the `Loggable` aspect has been added. We can use this aspect to log debug messages instead of using the `Tv` aspect.

To apply the patch, replace the import statement for `Tv` with the import statement for `Loggable`, and add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class. We set the log level to `DEBUG` so that debug messages are logged.

Note that we cannot remove the `@Override` decorator because the method is still overriding a method in the new version. We cannot use any of the removed methods or classes, such as `Tv`. We can only use the added methods and classes, such as `Loggable`. We have made a change to the code by adding the `@Loggable` annotation.

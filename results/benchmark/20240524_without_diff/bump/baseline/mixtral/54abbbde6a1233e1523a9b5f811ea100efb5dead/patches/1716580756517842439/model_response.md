Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv(41)
@Override
public Ssh ssh() {
    return Ssh.create(this.config().username(), this.config().password(), this.config().host(), this.config().port());
}
```

In this patch, we're using the `Ssh` class from the jcabi-ssh library, which is an alternative to the `SshByPassword` class that seems to have been removed. We're also using the `create` method from the `Ssh` class to create an `Ssh` instance with the same parameters as before.

Note that the `Tv` annotation has been updated to version 41, which corresponds to the version of the jcabi-ssh library that includes the `Ssh` class.

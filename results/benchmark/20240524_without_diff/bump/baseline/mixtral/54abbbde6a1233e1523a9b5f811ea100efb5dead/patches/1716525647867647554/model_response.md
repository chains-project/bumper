Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
  // existing code...
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced by the `Loggable` aspect. To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` import with `Loggable`, and add the `@Loggable` annotation to the `SshByPassword` class. This will enable logging for the class, similar to what the `Tv` aspect did in the previous version. Note that the `Loggable` aspect takes a log level as an argument, which I have set to `DEBUG` here. You can adjust this level as needed.

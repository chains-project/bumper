Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh ssh() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've imported `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. This is because the error message indicates that the `Tv` class cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. Instead, we can use the `@Tv` annotation directly on the `ssh()` method. This way, we can avoid the need to import the `Tv` class directly.

Additionally, I've removed the `override` decorator from the `ssh()` method because it is not overriding any method in the new version of the library. This is allowed by the rules you provided.

Finally, I've left the method implementation blank because it was not provided in the original code snippet. You can fill in the implementation as needed.

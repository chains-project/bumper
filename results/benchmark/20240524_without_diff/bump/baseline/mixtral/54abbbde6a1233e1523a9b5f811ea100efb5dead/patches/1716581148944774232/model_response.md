Here's a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    private Ssh ssh;

    public MyClass() {
        this.ssh = new Ssh("my-host", 22, "my-user", "my-password");
    }

    // Rest of the class remains unchanged
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation with the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation on the class level. Additionally, I've created a `ssh` variable of type `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` and initialized it in the constructor. This way, you can continue using the `Ssh` class from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package.

Note that I've used the `0.15.2` version of `com.jcabi.ssh` package, which is the latest version available at the time of writing. You may need to adjust the version number based on the version you want to use.

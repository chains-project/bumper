Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public SshByPassword sshByPassword() {
        // Your existing code here
    }
}
```
To fix the error, we need to remove the direct import of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead use the `@Tv` annotation on the `sshByPassword` method. We can still use the `@Tv` annotation because it has not been removed in the new library version.

Note that I cannot see the existing code for the `sshByPassword` method, so I left it as is. You should replace the comment `// Your existing code here` with your actual code for the method.

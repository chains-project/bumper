Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public void myMethod() {
        SshByPassword ssh = new SshByPassword("user", "password", "host");
        // use ssh object here
    }
}
```
Note that I imported `com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`, and created a `SshByPassword` object to use in the method. I also added the `@Tv` annotation to the method, which was previously imported from `com.jcabi.aspects`. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile with the new library version.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.22", "0.15.23", "0.15.24"})
public class MyClass {
    private final Ssh ssh = new Ssh("my-host", 22, "my-user", "my-pass");

    // rest of the class
}
```
This patch replaces the failing import statement with a new one for the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class. It also creates a new `Ssh` instance with explicit host, port, user, and password values, which should resolve the failure caused by the missing symbol in the original code.

The `@Tv` annotation is used to specify the allowed versions of the `jcabi-ssh` library that this code is compatible with. In this case, the annotation specifies that the code is compatible with versions `0.15.22`, `0.15.23`, and `0.15.24`.

Note that the `@Override` decorator has been removed from the `MyClass` class, as it was not overriding any method in the new version. Also, no new methods have been added or removed from the `Ssh` class, so the original method signature has not been changed.

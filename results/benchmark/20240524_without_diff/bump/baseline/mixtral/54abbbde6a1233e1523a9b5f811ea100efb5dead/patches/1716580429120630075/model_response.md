Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("user", "password", "host");
        // ... use ssh object here ...
    }
}
```

This patch uses the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` aspect. It also creates a new `Ssh` object with the required parameters. Note that I assumed that the missing symbol is the `Ssh` class. If the missing symbol is a different class or method, the patch would need to be adjusted accordingly.

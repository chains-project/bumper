Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("my-server", 22, "my-user", "my-password");
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch replaces the failed import statement with a new one that imports `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`. The `Ssh` class is part of the `jcabi-ssh` library, which has been added in version `0.15.2`.

The `@Tv` annotation is used to specify the minimum version of the library that the client code depends on. In this case, it's set to `0.15.2`, which is the minimum version that includes the `Ssh` class.

The `myMethod` method has been updated to create a new `Ssh` object using the constructor that takes a server address, port, username, and password. This constructor was added in version `0.15.2` of the `jcabi-ssh` library.

Note that the `@Override` annotation has been removed from the `myMethod` method, as it's not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

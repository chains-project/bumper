Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("user", "password", "host");
        // rest of the method code
    }
}
```
In this patch, I imported the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation. I also added the `@Tv` annotation to the `myMethod` method to mimic the behavior of the original code. Note that the `@Tv` annotation does not actually do anything in this context, but it is necessary to maintain the same method signature as the original code.

Additionally, I added a sample implementation for the `Ssh` constructor to show how it can be used in the method. You can replace this implementation with your own code as needed.

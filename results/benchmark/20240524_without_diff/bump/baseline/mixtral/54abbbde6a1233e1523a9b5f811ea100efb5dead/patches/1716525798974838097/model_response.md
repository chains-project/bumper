Here's a patch that you can apply to the client code to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // existing code
    }
}
```

The patch imports the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package, instead of using the `Tv` aspect from `com.jcabi.aspects`. This way, the code can still use the `@Tv` annotation, but without relying on the `com.jcabi.aspects` package.

Note that this patch assumes that the `@Tv` annotation is still present and functional in the new library version. If the `@Tv` annotation has been removed or modified in the new version, then you may need to modify the code further.

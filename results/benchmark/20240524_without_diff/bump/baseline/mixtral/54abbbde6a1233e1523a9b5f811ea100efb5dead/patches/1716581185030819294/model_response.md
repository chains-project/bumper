Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.22", "0.15.23", "0.15.24", "0.15.25"})
public class MyClass {
    private Ssh ssh;

    public MyClass() {
        this.ssh = new Ssh("my-ssh-server.com", 22, "username", "password");
    }

    // Rest of the class remains unchanged
}
```

In this patch, I have imported the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation. I have also created an instance of the `Ssh` class in the constructor of `MyClass`. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error for the `Ssh` class.

Note: Depending on the specific version of the jcabi-ssh library you are using, you may need to adjust the constructor arguments for the `Ssh` class. Please consult the jcabi-ssh documentation for more information.

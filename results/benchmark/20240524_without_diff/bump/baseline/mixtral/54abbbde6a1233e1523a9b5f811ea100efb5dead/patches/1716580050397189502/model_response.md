Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv("1.0")
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we have imported the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` aspect. This allows us to use the `@Tv` annotation directly on the `SshByPassword` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Ssh.ByPassword` interface has not been removed or modified in the new version of the library. If this is not the case, a different approach may be necessary.

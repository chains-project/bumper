Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.22", "0.15.23"})
public class MyClass {
    private Ssh ssh;

    public MyClass() {
        this.ssh = new Ssh("my-ssh-server.com", 22);
    }

    // rest of the class
}
```
In this patch, I've imported the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of using the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` aspect. I've also created a new instance of `Ssh` in the constructor of the class.

Note that I had to make a guess about the hostname and port number for the SSH server. You'll need to replace `"my-ssh-server.com"` and `22` with the actual hostname and port number for your SSH server.

Also, note that the `@Tv` annotation is used to indicate that this class is compatible with versions `0.15.22` and `0.15.23` of the `jcabi-ssh` library. You can adjust the version numbers as needed for your specific use case.

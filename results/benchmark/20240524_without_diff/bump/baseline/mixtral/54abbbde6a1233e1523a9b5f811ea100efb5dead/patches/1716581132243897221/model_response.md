Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("my-server.com", 22, "username", "password");
        // rest of the method
    }
}
```

Note that I replaced the import statement with the direct import of the `Ssh` class from the `jcabi-ssh` library. I also created an instance of `Ssh` using its constructor, instead of using the deprecated `Ssh.create()` method.

This code should fix the error by removing the dependency on the deprecated `jcabi-aspects` library. However, please note that this may break any other parts of the code that rely on the `@Tv` annotation from `jcabi-aspects`. If that's the case, you may need to find an alternative way to enforce the required version of the `jcabi-ssh` library.

Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The `Tv` class from `com.jcabi.aspects` was removed in the new library version. However, the `Loggable` aspect from the same package can be used instead. I added the `@Loggable` annotation to the `SshByPassword` class with the `DEBUG` level. This should fix the error and provide similar functionality to the original code.

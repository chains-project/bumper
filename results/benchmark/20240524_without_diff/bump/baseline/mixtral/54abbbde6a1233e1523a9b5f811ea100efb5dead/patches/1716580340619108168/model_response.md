Here is a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.sshj.SshClient;

@Tv(42)
public class Ssh {
    public SshClient connect(String host) throws IOException {
        SshClient ssh = new SshClient();
        ssh.connect(host);
        return ssh;
    }
}
```

This patch replaces the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation with the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation, which should be available in the newer version of the library. It also replaces the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class with the `com.jcabi.sshj.SshClient` class, which should be available in the newer version of the library.

Note: I am assuming that the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` annotation is still available in the newer version of the library, as it is not mentioned as being removed. If this is not the case, you may need to find an alternative way to implement the same functionality.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.22", "0.15.23", "0.15.24", "0.15.25"})
public class MyClass {
    private Ssh ssh;

    public MyClass() {
        this.ssh = new Ssh("my-ssh-server.com", 22);
    }

    // existing methods...
}
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with a new import statement for `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`. It also adds a `Tv` annotation to specify the allowed versions of the `jcabi-ssh` library.

Note that the `Tv` annotation is not strictly necessary to fix the error, but it can help prevent similar errors from occurring in the future by specifying the allowed versions of the library.

Additionally, the patch creates a new `ssh` variable of type `Ssh` and initializes it in the constructor of the `MyClass` class. This is just an example of how the `Ssh` class can be used in the client code, and it may need to be modified depending on the specific use case.

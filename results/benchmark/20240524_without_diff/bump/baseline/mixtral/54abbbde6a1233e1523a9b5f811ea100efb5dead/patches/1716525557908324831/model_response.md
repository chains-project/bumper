Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```

The patch imports the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package, instead of using the `Tv` aspect from `com.jcabi.aspects`. This is possible because the `Ssh` class is still available in the new library version.

The `@Tv` annotation is left in place, as it is still a valid annotation in the new library version. However, it is possible that the behavior of the `connect()` method may change as a result of this patch. If the `Tv` aspect was used to enforce certain constraints on the `connect()` method, those constraints may no longer be enforced.

Note that this patch assumes that the `MyClass` class is part of the client code that you are allowed to modify. If `MyClass` is part of the external library, then a different approach may be necessary.

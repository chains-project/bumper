Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({"0.15.2"})
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        Ssh ssh = new Ssh("user", "password", "host");
        // ... continue using Ssh object
    }
}
```
This patch removes the direct dependency on the problematic `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead uses the `@Tv` annotation directly on the class. It also creates an instance of `Ssh` using its constructor instead of relying on the deprecated `.create(String)` method.

Note that the version number in the `@Tv` annotation may need to be adjusted based on the actual version of the `jcabi-ssh` library being used.

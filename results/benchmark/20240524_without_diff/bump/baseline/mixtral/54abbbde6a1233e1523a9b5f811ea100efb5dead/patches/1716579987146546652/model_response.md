Here's a possible patch for the given failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv(4)
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh.ByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replaced the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with the one for `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`. This is because the error message suggests that the failure is caused by a missing symbol in `com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword`.

We also added the `import` statement for `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` to ensure that the `Ssh` interface can be used.

Finally, we changed the `@Tv` annotation to use version 4 instead of the default version. This is because the `SshByPassword` class is expected to implement the `Ssh.ByPassword` interface, which was introduced in version 4 of the `com.jcabi.ssh` library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `SshByPassword` class was originally implemented as a concrete implementation of the `Ssh.ByPassword` interface. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

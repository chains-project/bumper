Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```
Note that I replaced the import statement with the correct one for the `Ssh` class, and left the `@Tv` annotation in place, assuming that it's not causing any issues and is still needed for some reason. If it's not needed, you can simply remove it.

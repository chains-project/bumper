Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public Ssh connect() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```
In this patch, I have imported `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. The `@Tv` annotation is still present, indicating that the method should return a value that can be converted to a `long` or `Long`. This should fix the error message you encountered.

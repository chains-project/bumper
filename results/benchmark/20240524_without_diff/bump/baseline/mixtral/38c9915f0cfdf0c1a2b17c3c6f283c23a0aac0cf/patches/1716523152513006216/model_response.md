Here is a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.BytesOf;
import org.cactoos.text.Text;

...

public class Wallet {
    ...
    @Override
    public Text address() throws IOException {
        final Text input = new BytesOf(new HexOf(new BytesOf(new Base64Decoded(new TextOfScalar(addressScalar()))));
        return new Base64Encoded(input);
    }
    ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `SplitText` class with the `BytesOf` and `Base64Decoded` classes, which are new in the updated library version. I also added a `Text` variable to make the code easier to read. The rest of the code remains the same.

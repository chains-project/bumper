Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

@Override
public Scalar<Wallets> wallets(String owner) throws IOException {
  return new UncheckedScalar<>(() -> api.wallets(owner));
}
```
This patch uses the `UncheckedScalar` class from the `cactoos` library instead of `SolidScalar`. The `UncheckedScalar` class is similar to `SolidScalar`, but it does not wrap the checked exception `IOException` in an unchecked exception. Instead, it allows the caller to handle the checked exception directly.

Note that this patch assumes that the `api.wallets(owner)` method still exists and has the same signature as before. If this method has been removed or changed, then this patch may not work. In that case, you would need to modify the patch accordingly.

Here's a patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
The failure was caused by a missing semicolon. I've added a semicolon at the end of the first line. Additionally, I've created a `scalar` variable to make the code easier to understand.

The `StickyScalar` class is a replacement for the deprecated `Sticky` class. It has the same functionality and can be used interchangeably. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

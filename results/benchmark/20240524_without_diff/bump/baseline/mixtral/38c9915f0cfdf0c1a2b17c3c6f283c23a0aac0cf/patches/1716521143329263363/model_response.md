Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public double rtScore(String repoId) throws IOException {
  long size = new LengthOf(new GithubRepo(repoId)).intValue();
  // ...
}
```

This patch imports the new `LengthOf` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package and uses it instead of the removed `LengthOf` class from the `org.cactoos.iterable` package. The `LengthOf` class now expects an `Iterable` or an `Input` object as its argument, so we create a `GithubRepo` object that implements the `Input` interface and pass it to the `LengthOf` constructor. We then call the `intValue` method to get the length of the input as an integer.

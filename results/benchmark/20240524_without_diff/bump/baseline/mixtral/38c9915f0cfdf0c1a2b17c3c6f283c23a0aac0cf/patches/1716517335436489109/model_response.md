Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

import java.util.function.Supplier;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> 42);
Solid<Integer> solid = new ScalarOfSupplier<>(scalar::get);

// Use 'solid' instead of 'SolidScalar'
```

Explanation:

* The `SolidScalar` class has been removed in the new library version, so we cannot use it anymore.
* Instead, we can use the `ScalarOfSupplier` class, which takes a `Supplier` of the scalar value.
* We can create a `Supplier` by using a lambda expression that returns the scalar value.
* To make sure that the scalar value is not recalculated every time it is accessed, we can use the `Sticky` class to memoize the value.
* Finally, we can use the `Solid` class to convert the `Scalar` to a `Solid` object, which can be used in the same way as `SolidScalar` was used before.

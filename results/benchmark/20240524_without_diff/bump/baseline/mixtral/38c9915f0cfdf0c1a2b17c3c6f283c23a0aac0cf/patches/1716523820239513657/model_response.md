Here's a patch that you can apply to the client code to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;

// ...

Text randomText = new TextOf("some random text");
```
In this patch, we use the `TextOf` class to create a new `Text` object, which is a replacement for the `RandomText` class that has been removed in the new library version. The `TextOf` class takes an `Iterator` as its constructor argument, but for simplicity, we pass a string to its static factory method `TextOf.string(String)` instead.

Note that this patch assumes that the functionality of `RandomText` is not needed in the client code. If the randomness of the text is important, you may need to find a different way to generate random text.

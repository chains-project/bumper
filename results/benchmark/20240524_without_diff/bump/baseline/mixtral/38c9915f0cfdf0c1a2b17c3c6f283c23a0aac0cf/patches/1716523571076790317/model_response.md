Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

@Override
public Beneficiary taxBeneficiary(Iterable<Transaction> transactions) throws IOException {
    long length = new LengthOf(transactions).longValue();
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:
In the new version of the library, the `LengthOf` class is now part of the `org.cactoos.scalar` package instead of `org.cactoos.iterable`. The method signature for calculating the length of an `Iterable` has not changed, so we can simply update the import statement and adjust the class name accordingly.

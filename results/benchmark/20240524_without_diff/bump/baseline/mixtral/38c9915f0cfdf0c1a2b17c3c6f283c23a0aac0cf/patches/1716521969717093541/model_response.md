Here's the patched code snippet that replaces the failing one:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<Foo> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> new Foo());
```

This code creates a `Sticky` scalar using a lambda expression that returns a new `Foo` instance. The `Sticky` scalar caches the result of the first evaluation and reuses it for subsequent calls.

In the original code, `StickyScalar` was used. However, it has been removed in the new version. Instead, the `Sticky` class can be used, which provides similar functionality.

Note that the `Foo` class should be defined in your codebase, as it's not part of the Cactoos library. Replace it with the actual class that you need to use.

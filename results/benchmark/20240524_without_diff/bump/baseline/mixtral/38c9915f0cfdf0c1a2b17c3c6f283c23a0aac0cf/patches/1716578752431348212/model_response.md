Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 4.0);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is missing, but looking at the code there is no obvious missing semicolon. However, the import statement is trying to import a class that no longer exists in the dependency. I replaced the import statement with the correct one and added a line to create a `StickyScalar` object. The `StickyScalar` class is a replacement for the deprecated `Sticky` class. I also added a lambda expression that returns a double value of 4.0 to the `StickyScalar` object.

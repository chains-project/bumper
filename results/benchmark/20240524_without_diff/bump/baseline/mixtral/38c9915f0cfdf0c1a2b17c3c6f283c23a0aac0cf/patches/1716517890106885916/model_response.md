Here's the patched version of the client code that fixes the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.NoNulls;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

Scalar<String> value = // your scalar value here
NoNulls<String> noNulls = new NoNulls<>(value);
UncheckedScalar<String> unchecked = new UncheckedScalar<>(noNulls);
```

In this patch, we replaced the direct usage of `UncheckedScalar` with a combination of `NoNulls` and `UncheckedScalar`. This way, we can still achieve the same functionality while using only the added classes in the new library version.

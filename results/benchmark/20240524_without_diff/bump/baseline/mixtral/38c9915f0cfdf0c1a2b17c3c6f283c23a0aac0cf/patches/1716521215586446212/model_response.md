Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public double score(User user) throws IOException {
  double result = 0;
  try (InputStream input = new URL(user.url()).openStream()) {
    result = new LengthOf(input).intValue();
  }
  return result;
}
```
In this patch, we import the new `LengthOf` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package, and use it to calculate the length of the input stream. Note that the `LengthOf` class now takes an `Input` object as its constructor argument, instead of an `Iterable`. Therefore, we need to create an `InputStream` from the user's URL and pass it to the `LengthOf` constructor. We also need to use the `intValue()` method to convert the length from a `Scalar` to a primitive `int` value.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

// ...

Scalar<Double> scalar = new UncheckedScalar<>(() -> 42.0);
Solid<Double> solid = new ScalarOf<>(scalar);
```

This code creates a `Scalar` instance using a lambda expression, and then converts it to a `Solid` instance using the `ScalarOf` class, which is a new addition in the updated library version. The `UncheckedScalar` class is also used to wrap the lambda expression, as the `Scalar` constructor now requires a `Check` argument.

Note that the type of the `scalar` variable has been changed from `SolidScalar` to `Scalar`, as the `SolidScalar` class has been removed in the updated library version. Also, the `Double` type parameter has been added to both `Scalar` and `Solid` to specify the type of the scalar value.

You can replace the failing code with this patch to make it work with the updated library version.

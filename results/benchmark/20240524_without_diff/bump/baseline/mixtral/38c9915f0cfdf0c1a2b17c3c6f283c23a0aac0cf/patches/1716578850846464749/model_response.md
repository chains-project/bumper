Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that a semicolon is expected at line 29, column 33. This suggests that there might be a missing statement or a syntax error.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the `Sticky` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package is being imported, but it should be `Scalar` instead.

Therefore, I replaced the incorrect import statement with the correct one and created a `Scalar` object using the `StickyScalar` class, which implements the `Scalar` interface.

This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

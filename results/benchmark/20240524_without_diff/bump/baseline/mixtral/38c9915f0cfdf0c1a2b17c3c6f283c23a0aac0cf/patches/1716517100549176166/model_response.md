Here is a possible patch for the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.io.Joined;

//...

JoinedText joined = new JoinedText(", ", new Joined(input));
```
This patch replaces the use of the deprecated `JoinedText` class with the new `Joined` class, which has a similar purpose and functionality. The `Joined` class is used to join multiple inputs into a single one, separated by a delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is set to a comma and a space (", "). The `Joined` class is used in conjunction with the `JoinedText` class, which converts the joined input into a `Text` object, which can be used in the rest of the code.

Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoChecked;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = // ...;
IoChecked<Bytes> ioCheckedBytes = IoChecked.of(bytes);
Bytes content = ioCheckedBytes.value();
```
In this fixed version, I replaced the usage of the removed `IoCheckedScalar` class with the new `IoChecked` class. This new class can be found in the `org.cactoos.scalar` package. I also added a new variable `ioCheckedBytes` to store the result of the `IoChecked.of` method, which returns an `IoChecked<Bytes>` object. This object can then be used to get the actual content using the `value()` method.

By making these changes, the client code should now work with the new version of the library.

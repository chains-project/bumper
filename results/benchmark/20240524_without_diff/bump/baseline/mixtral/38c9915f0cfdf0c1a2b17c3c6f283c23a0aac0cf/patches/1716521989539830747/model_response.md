Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> 42);
```

In this patch, we're importing the `Scalar` interface from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package, which is still present in the new library version. We're then creating a `Sticky` scalar that always returns the value `42`. You can replace `42` with any other value or expression that fits your use case.

Note that the `StickyScalar` class has been removed in the new library version, so we can no longer use it directly. Instead, we can create a `Sticky` scalar using a lambda expression that returns the desired value. This should achieve the same functionality as the original `StickyScalar` class.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<Boolean> isValid = new Sticky<>(() -> someCondition());

// ...

if (isValid.value()) {
  // ...
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `SolidScalar` with `Scalar` and uses a `Sticky` scalar to ensure that the condition is only evaluated once. The `someCondition()` method should return a `boolean` value representing the condition you want to check. Adjust the method as needed.

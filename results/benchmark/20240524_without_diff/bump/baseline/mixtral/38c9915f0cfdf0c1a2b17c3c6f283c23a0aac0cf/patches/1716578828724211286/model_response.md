Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates a missing ';' at line 29, column 33. Looking at the provided code, there's only one line of code, and it's a single import statement. The error is likely caused by a change in the imported library (`org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky`), which might have been removed or renamed.

To fix the issue, I imported the required class (`org.cactoos.Scalar` and `org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar`) and created a `Scalar` object using the `StickyScalar` class. The lambda expression initializes the scalar to 0.0. This should resolve the compilation error and provide a working alternative to the original code.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered;

// ...

Filtered<SomeType> filtered = new Filtered<>(someIterable, someFunc);
```
In this patch, I changed the import statement to use `org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered` instead of `org.cactoos.collection.Filtered`. The constructor for `Filtered` has also been updated to match the new method signature.

Note that `SomeType` and `someIterable`, `someFunc` are placeholders for the actual types and variables that you need to use. Replace them with the appropriate types and variables that match your specific use case.

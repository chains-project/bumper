Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
In this patch, we import the `Scalar` interface from the `org.cactoos` package, and use it along with `StickyScalar` to create a scalar value of type `Double`. This should fix the error related to the missing ';' character.

Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

// ...

Scalar<Double> balance = new UncheckedScalar<>(() -> {
    // Balance calculation logic here
});

// Use the balance scalar instead of SolidScalar
```

This patch replaces the `SolidScalar` import with `Scalar` and `UncheckedScalar`. Then, it creates a `balance` variable of type `Scalar<Double>` initialized with an `UncheckedScalar` that contains the balance calculation logic. Finally, you can use the `balance` scalar in your code instead of `SolidScalar`.

This patch assumes that the balance calculation logic is available and can be adapted to your specific use case.

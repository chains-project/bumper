Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;

import static org.cactoos.iterable.ConstantOf.constant;

@Override
public Scalar<Iterable<Wallet>> wallets() throws IOException {
  return () -> constant(new Wallets(api()));
}
```

This patch replaces the missing `SolidScalar` with the more generic `Scalar` interface from the same library. It also introduces a new utility class `ConstantOf` to create a constant scalar value for the result. The implementation of the `wallets()` method remains unchanged.

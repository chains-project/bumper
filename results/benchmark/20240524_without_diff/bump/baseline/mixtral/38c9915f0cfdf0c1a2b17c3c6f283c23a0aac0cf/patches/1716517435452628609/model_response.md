Here is a fixed version of the code that uses the new `IoCheckedBytes` class instead of the removed `IoCheckedScalar`:

```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;

// ...

public class WalletsIn {
    // ...

    private IoCheckedBytes loadWallets() throws IOException {
        try (InputStream is = new FileInputStream(new File(this.dir, "wallets.txt"))) {
            return new IoCheckedBytes(is);
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

This code uses the `IoCheckedBytes` class to read the contents of the `wallets.txt` file as a checked byte sequence. The `IoCheckedBytes` class is a new addition to the library and can be used to safely read the contents of an input stream as a byte sequence, while automatically handling any checked exceptions that may be thrown during the read operation.

Note that I had to make a few assumptions about the surrounding code, since it was not provided in the original example. In particular, I assumed that the `WalletsIn` class has a `dir` field that represents the directory where the `wallets.txt` file is located. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
In this patch, we replaced the import statement for `Sticky` with the import statement for `Scalar` and `StickyScalar`. We then created a new variable `scalar` of type `Scalar<Double>` and initialized it with a new instance of `StickyScalar` that takes a lambda expression returning a double value of 0.0. This should resolve the error message about the missing semicolon.

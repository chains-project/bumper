Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoChecked;

...

public IoChecked<InputStream> input(String path) throws IOException {
  return new IoChecked<>(
    new IoCheckedScalar<>(
      new ScalarOf<>(
        () -> new FileInputStream(path)
      )
    )
  );
}
```
Explanation:
The original code uses `IoCheckedScalar` which has been removed from the library. We can replace it with `IoChecked`, which is a new class added in the updated library. `IoChecked` takes a `Scalar` and a `Fallback` as arguments. In this case, we can use `ScalarOf` to create a `Scalar` that returns the result of a `Callable`. The `Callable` simply returns a new `FileInputStream` for the given path. Since `FileInputStream` can throw an `IOException`, we need to wrap it in a `CheckedScalar` to handle the exception. However, since `IoChecked` already handles exceptions, we can remove the `CheckedScalar` and just pass the `Callable` directly to `ScalarOf`. This results in the final code above.

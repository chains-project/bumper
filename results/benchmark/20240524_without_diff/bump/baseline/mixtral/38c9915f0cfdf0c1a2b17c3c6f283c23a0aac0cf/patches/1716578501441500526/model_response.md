Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

Scalar<InputStream> scalar = new IoCheckedScalar<>(HttpResponse::getBody);
```

This code creates a new `IoCheckedScalar` object using the `HttpResponse::getBody` method as the scalar value. This method should be available in the new version of the library. The `scalar` variable can then be used in place of the original code that caused the error.

Here's the fixed version of the code that uses the new `Solid` class added in the updated library:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.Solid;

// ...

public class WalletsIn implements In<Wallet> {
  // ...

  @Override
  protected Wallet valueOf(final String code) throws IOException {
    try (InputStream is = new URL(url(code)).openStream()) {
      return new JsonInput(is).input(new Solid<Wallet>(
        new ScalarOf<Wallet>(() -> Wallet.fromJson(new JsonReader(is)))
      ));
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

The `SolidScalar` class has been removed and replaced with the `Solid` class. The `Solid` class takes a `Scalar` as its constructor argument and returns the result of the `Scalar`'s computation. In this case, a `ScalarOf` is used to create a `Scalar` that returns the result of `Wallet.fromJson(new JsonReader(is))`.

Note: I am assuming that the `JsonInput` and `JsonReader` classes are from a library that has not changed and are still available for use.

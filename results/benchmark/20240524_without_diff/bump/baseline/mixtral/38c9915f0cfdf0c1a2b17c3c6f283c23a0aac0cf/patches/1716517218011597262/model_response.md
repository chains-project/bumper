Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarOf;

// ...

import static java.util.Arrays.stream;

// ...

Scalar<Double> sum = new ScalarOf<>(() -> stream(numbers)
  .mapToDouble(Number::doubleValue)
  .sum()
);
```

In this patch, I replaced the usage of `SolidScalar` with `ScalarOf`, which is an added method in the new library version. The `ScalarOf` method takes a `java.util.function.Supplier` as an argument, so I created a lambda expression that calculates the sum of the `numbers` array using the `doubleValue()` method from the `Number` interface.

Please note that this patch assumes that the `numbers` variable is an array of `Number` objects. If the type of `numbers` is different, you may need to adjust the lambda expression accordingly.

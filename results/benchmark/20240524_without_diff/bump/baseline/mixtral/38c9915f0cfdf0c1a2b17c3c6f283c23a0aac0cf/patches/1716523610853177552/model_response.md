Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;

import java.util.Iterator;

public class Remote {
    ...
    @Override
    protected Text createText() {
        Iterator<Character> chars = new Iterator<Character>() {
            @Override
            public boolean hasNext() {
                return true;
            }

            @Override
            public Character next() {
                return (char) (Math.random() * 256);
            }
        };
        return new TextOf(chars);
    }
    ...
}
```

This patch replaces the use of `RandomText` with a custom implementation of `Text` that generates random characters. The `TextOf` class is used to create a `Text` instance from an iterator of characters.

Note that the `TextOf` constructor that takes an iterator was added in the new version of the library, so it can be used in the patched code.

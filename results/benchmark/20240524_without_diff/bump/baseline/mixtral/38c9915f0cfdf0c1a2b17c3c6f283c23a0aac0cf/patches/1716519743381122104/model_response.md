Here's the patched code that replaces the failing import statement and uses the new IoCheckedBytes class:

```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;

// ...

IoCheckedBytes bytes = new IoCheckedBytes(new BytesOf("some bytes"));
byte[] result = bytes.asBytes();
```

In this example, `BytesOf` is a utility class that converts a string to a `Bytes` object. You can replace it with your own implementation.

The `IoCheckedBytes` class is a new addition to the library, and it can be used to wrap a `Bytes` object and provide checked I/O operations, such as reading and writing to a file. In this example, we use the `asBytes` method to get the underlying byte array.

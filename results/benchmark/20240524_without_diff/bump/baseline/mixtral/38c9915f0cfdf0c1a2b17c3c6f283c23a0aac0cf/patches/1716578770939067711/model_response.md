Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that there is a missing ';' character. Looking at the import statement, it seems that the class `Sticky` is being imported from the package `org.cactoos.scalar`. In the failing code, it looks like `Sticky` is being used as a type directly, but it should be used as a type parameter for the `StickyScalar` class.
To fix the error, I created a variable `scalar` of type `Scalar<Double>` and initialized it to a new `StickyScalar` instance that takes a lambda expression as a parameter. The lambda expression returns a double value of 0.0, which can be replaced with the actual value needed for the application.
Additionally, I imported the `Scalar` interface from the same package as `StickyScalar`, since it is a superinterface of `StickyScalar`.
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

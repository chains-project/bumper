Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.LengthOf;

// ...

public double length() throws IOException {
  return new LengthOf(input()).longValue();
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `LengthOf` class cannot be found in the `org.cactoos.iterable` package. Upon checking the library changes, we can see that the `LengthOf` class has been moved to the `org.cactoos.scalar` package.
To fix the error, we need to import the `LengthOf` class from the new package and update the code to use the new location of the `LengthOf` class.
In the fixed code, we import the `LengthOf` class from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package and update the `length()` method to create a `LengthOf` object using the `input()` method and call the `longValue()` method to get the length of the input.

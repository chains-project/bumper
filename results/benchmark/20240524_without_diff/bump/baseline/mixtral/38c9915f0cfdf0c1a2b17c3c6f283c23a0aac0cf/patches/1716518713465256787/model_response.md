Here's the patched version of the client code that uses the added `Sticky` class from the new library version:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

private Sticky<Transaction> stickyTransaction;

// ...

@Override
public Transaction transaction() {
    if (stickyTransaction == null) {
        stickyTransaction = new Sticky<>(() -> transactionPool.get());
    }
    return stickyTransaction.value();
}
```

This code creates a `Sticky` instance that always returns the same value for the same input. In this case, it returns a `Transaction` instance from a transaction pool.

Note that the `Sticky` class requires a `Callable` as its constructor argument, so we create a lambda expression that returns a `Transaction` instance.

Also note that we check if `stickyTransaction` is `null` before creating a new instance. This ensures that we only create one instance of `Sticky` per request.

Finally, we call the `value()` method on `stickyTransaction` to get the `Transaction` instance.

This code should fix the "cannot find symbol" error you were seeing and allow your code to compile and run correctly with the new library version.

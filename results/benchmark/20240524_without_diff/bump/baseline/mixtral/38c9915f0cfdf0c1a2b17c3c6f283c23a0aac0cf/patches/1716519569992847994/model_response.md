Sure, I can help you fix the error. The `SolidScalar` class has been removed in the new version of the library. Instead, you can use the `Solid` class which serves a similar purpose. Here's the updated code:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.Solid;

// ...

Solid<Double> balance = new Solid<>(() -> wallet.balance());
```
In this code, we create a `Solid` scalar that wraps a lambda expression that returns the balance of a `wallet` object. The `Solid` class ensures that the lambda expression is only executed once and its result is cached for subsequent accesses.

Note that the return type of the lambda expression should match the type of the scalar. In this case, I assumed that the balance is a `double` value, but you may need to adjust the type according to your specific use case.

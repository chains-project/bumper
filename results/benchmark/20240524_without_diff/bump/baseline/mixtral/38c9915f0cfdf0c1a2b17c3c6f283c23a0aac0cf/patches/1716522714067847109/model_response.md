Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ...; // get the scalar value you need
Bytes uncheckedBytes = new ScalarEnvelope<>(bytes);
```
Explanation:
The `UncheckedScalar` class has been removed in the new library version. However, the `ScalarEnvelope` class has been added, which can be used to wrap a `Scalar` and make it behave like an `UncheckedScalar`. The `ScalarEnvelope` class provides a `value()` method that returns the wrapped `Scalar`'s value, which can be used in place of the `UncheckedScalar`'s `value()` method.

In the patched code, we first create a `Scalar` object `bytes` that represents the value we need. We then create a new `ScalarEnvelope` object `uncheckedBytes` that wraps the `bytes` object. We can then use the `uncheckedBytes` object in place of the original `UncheckedScalar` object.

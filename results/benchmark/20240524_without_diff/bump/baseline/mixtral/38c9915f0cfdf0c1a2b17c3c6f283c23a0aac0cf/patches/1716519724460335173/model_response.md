Here's a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;

// ...

IoCheckedScalar<String> ioCheckedScalar = IoCheckedBytes::asString;
```
This code creates a new `IoCheckedScalar` instance using the `IoCheckedBytes::asString` method reference as the `Func` argument. This effectively converts an `IoCheckedBytes` instance to a `String`, just like the original `IoCheckedScalar` was doing.

Note that I had to make an assumption about the type of the value that the original `IoCheckedScalar` was supposed to hold, since it was not specified in the error message. In this case, I assumed that it was a `String`, but you may need to adjust the code if the actual type is different.

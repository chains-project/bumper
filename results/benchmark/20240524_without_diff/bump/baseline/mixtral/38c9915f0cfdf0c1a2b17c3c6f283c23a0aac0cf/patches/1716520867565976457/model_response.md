Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

//...

Scalar<Double> balance = new Sticky<>(() -> {
    // Your code to calculate the balance
});

//...

public Double getBalance() {
    return balance.value();
}
```

This patch uses the new `Sticky` class from the updated library to create a scalar that caches its value. Replace your existing `SolidScalar` usage with this new `Sticky` instance. Make sure to replace all occurrences of `SolidScalar` with `Scalar`.

In the provided example, replace the `// Your code to calculate the balance` comment with the code that calculates the balance.

Also, update the import statements to use the new package name `org.cactoos.scalar` instead of `org.cactoos.scalar`.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;
import org.cactoos.Scalar;

// ...

Scalar<ByteArrayResource> resource = // your original code here ...
IoCheckedBytes checkedResource = new IoCheckedBytes(resource);
byte[] bytes = checkedResource.asBytes();
```

In this patch, we've replaced the usage of `IoCheckedScalar` with `IoCheckedBytes`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. This new class can be used to read the contents of a `Scalar<ByteArrayResource>` and handle any checked exceptions that might be thrown during the process.

Note that the `IoCheckedBytes` class works with `byte[]` arrays, so we need to call `asBytes()` method to get the actual byte array from the `IoCheckedBytes` object.

You can replace the original failing code with this patch to fix the compilation error.

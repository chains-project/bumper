Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Io;
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

IoCheckedScalar<String> checkedIo(Io<String> io) {
  return new IoCheckedScalar<>(io);
}
```

This patch introduces a new method `checkedIo` that takes an `Io<String>` parameter and returns an `IoCheckedScalar<String>` object. This method can be used in place of the original import statement that caused the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Io` class is still available and has not been removed in the updated dependency. If the `Io` class has been removed, you may need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality.

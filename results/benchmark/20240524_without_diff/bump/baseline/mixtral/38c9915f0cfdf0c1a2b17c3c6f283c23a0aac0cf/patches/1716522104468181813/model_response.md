Here's the patched version of the client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<String> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> "some value");
String value = scalar.value();
```

The change here is the use of `Scalar` and `Sticky` from the new library version. The `StickyScalar` class has been removed, so we replace its usage with the `Sticky` decorator on a `Scalar`. The `Scalar` interface provides the `value()` method to obtain the value.

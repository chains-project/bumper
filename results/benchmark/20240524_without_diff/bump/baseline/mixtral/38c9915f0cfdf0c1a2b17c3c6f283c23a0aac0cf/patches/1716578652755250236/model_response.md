Here's a patch that you can apply to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky of;

Scalar<Integer> length = new of(() -> new LengthOf(yourIterable).intValue());
```

In this patch, we are using the `Sticky` class from the `cactoos` library to create a scalar that caches the length of the iterable, so that we can call `intValue()` on it to get the length. We then assign this scalar to the `length` variable, which you can use in place of the failed code.

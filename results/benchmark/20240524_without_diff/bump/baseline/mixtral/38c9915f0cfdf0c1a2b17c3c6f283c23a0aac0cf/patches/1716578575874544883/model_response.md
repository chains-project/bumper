Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.io.InputOf;

Scalar<String> ioCheckedScalar(java.io.InputStream input) throws IOException {
  return new IoCheckedScalar<>(new InputOf(input));
}
```

This code defines a new method `ioCheckedScalar` that takes an `InputStream` as its argument and returns a `Scalar<String>`. The method uses the `InputOf` class from the `cactoos-io` library to create an input stream, and then wraps it in a `IoCheckedScalar` object.

This should fix the error because it no longer depends on the `org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar` class, which is causing the "cannot find symbol" error. Instead, it uses the `IoCheckedScalar` class from the `cactoos-scalar` library, which should be available.

Note that the method signature has not been changed, and the `@Override` decorator has been removed since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

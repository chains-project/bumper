Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;

import static org.cactoos.iterable.ConstantOf.constant;

@Override
public Scalar<Iterable<Wallet>> values() throws IOException {
  return () -> this.wallets().stream()
    .filter(Wallet::isActive)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

This patch replaces the original import statement with the one that imports the `Scalar` interface from the Cactoos library. It also introduces a static import statement for the `constant` method from the `ConstantOf` class.

The `values` method has been rewritten to use the `Scalar` interface instead of the `SolidScalar` class. It now returns a `Scalar` that wraps an `Iterable` of `Wallet` objects, which are filtered to only include active wallets.

Note that this patch assumes that the `wallets` method, which was previously called with a `SolidScalar` parameter, has been modified to return an `Iterable` of `Wallet` objects instead. If this is not the case, the `values` method may need to be further modified to handle the new return type of the `wallets` method.

Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new Sticky<>(() -> 42);
```
This code creates a new `Sticky` scalar that always returns the integer value `42`. You can replace the original import statement for `StickyScalar` with the two import statements for `Scalar` and `Sticky` from the new library version.

Note that the original code was trying to use `StickyScalar` from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package, but this class has been removed in the new library version. Instead, you can use the `Sticky` class from the same package, which provides similar functionality.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

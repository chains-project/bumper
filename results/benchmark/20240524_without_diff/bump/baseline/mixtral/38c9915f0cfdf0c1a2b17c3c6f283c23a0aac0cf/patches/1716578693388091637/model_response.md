Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.StickyScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = new StickyScalar<>(() -> 0.0);
```
Explanation:
The error message suggests that a semicolon is expected at line 29, column 33. Looking at the code, it seems like the `Sticky` class from the `cactoos` library is being imported but not used. Instead, the `StickyScalar` class should be used.
To fix the error, I replaced the import statement with the correct one and created a new variable `scalar` of type `Scalar<Double>` initialized with a new `StickyScalar` instance that returns a double value of 0.0.
This way, the code should compile and run without errors.

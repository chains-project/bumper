Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarOf;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new ScalarOf<>(() -> 42);
// Use the scalar object as needed in your code
```

This patch replaces the usage of `SolidScalar` with a new `Scalar` instance created using the `ScalarOf` adapter. This adapter accepts a `java.util.concurrent.Callable` and returns a `Scalar` instance that can be used in the same way as `SolidScalar`. The `Callable` instance is created using a lambda expression that returns an `Integer` value of 42 in this example, but you can replace it with any logic needed for your specific use case.

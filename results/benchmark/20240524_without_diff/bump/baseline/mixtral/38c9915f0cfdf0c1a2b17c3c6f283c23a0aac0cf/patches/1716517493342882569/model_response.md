Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.cactoos.bytes.IoCheckedBytes;

//...

IoCheckedScalar<String> scalar = new IoCheckedScalar<>(() -> new IoCheckedBytes(new BytesOf("some value")).asBytes());
String value = scalar.value();
```
This code creates an `IoCheckedScalar` that wraps a function that returns an `IoCheckedBytes` object, which in turn wraps a `BytesOf` object that contains the string "some value". The `IoCheckedScalar` is then used to get the value as a string.

Note that the `BytesOf` class is a new addition in the updated library version, so it can be used in the fixed code. The `IoCheckedScalar` class has also been changed, but it can still be used in the same way as before, so it can be used in the fixed code as well.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Unchecked;

// ...

Scalar<Bytes> bytes = ...; // get your bytes scalar here
Unchecked<Bytes> uncheckedBytes = new Unchecked<>(bytes);
byte[] bytesArray = uncheckedBytes.value();
```
The `Unchecked` class is a new addition in the library version you provided, and it can be used to convert a `Scalar` to an `UncheckedScalar` without having to use the deprecated `UncheckedScalar` constructor.

In this patch, I assumed that you have a `Scalar<Bytes>` object called `bytes`. You can replace this part with the actual code you have to get your bytes scalar.

After getting the `Scalar<Bytes>` object, you can convert it to an `Unchecked<Bytes>` object using the `Unchecked` constructor, and then get the byte array using the `value()` method.

Note that this patch only shows how to get the byte array from the `Scalar<Bytes>` object. You may need to modify the rest of your code to use the byte array instead of the `UncheckedScalar<Bytes>` object.

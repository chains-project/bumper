Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Texts;

// ...

@Override
public String asString() throws IOException {
  return new JoinedText(
    Texts.splitBy("\n", read()),
    "\n"
  ).asString();
}
```

In this patch, we replaced the usage of the `JoinedText` class from the `cactoos` library with the `Texts` class from the same library. The `Texts` class provides a `splitBy` method that splits a given text into a list of substrings using a given delimiter. We then use the `JoinedText` class to join the substrings back together using the same delimiter. Finally, we convert the resulting `JoinedText` object to a string.

Note that this patch assumes that the `read` method used in the original code returns a string containing the text to be formatted. If the `read` method returns a different type of object, you may need to modify the argument passed to the `splitBy` method.

Also note that this patch uses the `Texts` class from the `cactoos` library, which was added in version 0.30 of the library. If your project uses an older version of the `cactoos` library, you may need to update the library to a newer version that includes the `Texts` class.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

// ...

Scalar<Double> balance = new UncheckedScalar<>(() -> getBalance());
```

This patch replaces the usage of `SolidScalar` with `UncheckedScalar`, which is an addition in the new library version. The `UncheckedScalar` constructor takes a `Callable` that returns the balance, so the `getBalance()` method is wrapped in a lambda expression. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error for `SolidScalar`.

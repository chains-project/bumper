Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarOf;

// ...

import static java.util.Arrays.stream;

// ...

Scalar<Iterable<String>> scalars = new ScalarOf<>(() -> stream(wallets.values())
  .map(Wallet::id)
  .toArray(String[]::new)
);
```

This patch replaces the usage of `SolidScalar` with `ScalarOf`, which is an added method in the new library version. The `ScalarOf` method takes a `Supplier` that generates the value when needed. In this case, it generates an array of `String` representing the IDs of the wallets.

This solution assumes that `wallets` is a `Map` containing `Wallet` instances and `Wallet` has an `id()` method that returns a `String`. If the types are different, adjust the code accordingly.

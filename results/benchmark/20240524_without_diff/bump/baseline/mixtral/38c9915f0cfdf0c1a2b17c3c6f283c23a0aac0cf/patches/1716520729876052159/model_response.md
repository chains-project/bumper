Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarOf;

// ...

Scalar<Integer> scalar = new ScalarOf<>(() -> 42);
// Use the 'scalar' object instead of the removed 'SolidScalar' class
```

This patch creates a `Scalar` object using the `ScalarOf` class, which is an added method in the new library version. The scalar object is then used in place of the removed `SolidScalar` class.

Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered;

// ...

public Iterable<Entry> entries() throws IOException {
  return new Filtered<>(
    new IterableOf<>(
      api().entries()
    ),
    new EntryFilter()
  );
}
```
Explanation:

- I replaced `org.cactoos.collection.Filtered` with `org.cactoos.iterable.Filtered` since the former is no longer available in the new library version.
- I kept the function signature and logic unchanged.
- I created a `EntryFilter` class that implements `Func<Entry, Boolean>` to filter the entries.

Here's the code for `EntryFilter`:
```java
import org.cactoos.Func;

public class EntryFilter implements Func<Entry, Boolean> {
  @Override
  public Boolean apply(Entry entry) {
    // Filter logic here
  }
}
```
Note: You'll need to replace `api().entries()` and the filter logic in `EntryFilter` with the actual code that returns an `Iterable<Entry>` and the filtering logic, respectively.

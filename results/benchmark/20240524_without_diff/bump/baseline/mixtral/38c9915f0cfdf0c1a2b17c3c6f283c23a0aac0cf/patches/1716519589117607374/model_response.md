Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

// ...

Scalar<Double> balance = new UncheckedScalar<>(() -> {
    // ... implementation to get the balance ...
});

// Use the balance scalar instead of SolidScalar
double b = balance.value();
```

This patch replaces the usage of `SolidScalar` with `Scalar` and `UncheckedScalar`. The `Scalar` interface is still present in the new library version, and `UncheckedScalar` can be used to wrap a supplier that might throw an exception. The `value()` method is called on the `UncheckedScalar` instance to get the balance.

This patch assumes that the balance can be represented as a double. If the balance has a different type, you should adjust the type accordingly (e.g., `Scalar<BigDecimal>` for decimal values).

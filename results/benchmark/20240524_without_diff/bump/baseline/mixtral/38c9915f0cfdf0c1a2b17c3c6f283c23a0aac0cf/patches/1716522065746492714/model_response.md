Here's the patched version of the client code that uses the new version of the library:

```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<String> value = // ...;
Sticky<String> sticky = new Sticky<>(value);
```

The `StickyScalar` class has been removed in the new version of the library and replaced with the `Sticky` class. The `Sticky` class works similarly to the `StickyScalar` class, but it is generic and can be used with any type of value.

In the patched code, we first declare a `Scalar` variable `value` to hold the original value. We then create a `Sticky` variable `sticky` that wraps the `value` variable and ensures that its value remains unchanged.

Note that the `StickyScalar` class is still available in the new version of the library for backward compatibility, but it is recommended to use the `Sticky` class instead.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the code in order to fix the error:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.UncheckedScalar;

Scalar<Double> scalar = () -> 42.0;
SolidScalar<Double> solidScalar = new UncheckedScalar<>(scalar);
```

This code creates a new `Scalar` object using the `UncheckedScalar` class from the `cactoos` library. The `UncheckedScalar` class wraps a `Scalar` object and provides a `SolidScalar` implementation. The `SolidScalar` interface is a subinterface of the `Scalar` interface and is used in the original code.

Note that this code assumes that the `Scalar` interface and the `UncheckedScalar` class are available in the `cactoos` library. If these classes are not available, you may need to update the `cactoos` dependency in your project to a version that includes these classes.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.Sticky;

// ...

Scalar<String> value = new Sticky<>(() -> "some value");
String result = value.value();
```

In this patch, we replaced the import statement to use the `Scalar` interface instead of the specific `StickyScalar` class. Then, we created a new `Sticky` scalar that returns a string value. Finally, we called the `value()` method on the scalar to get the result.

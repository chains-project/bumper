Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.Scalar;
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoChecked;
import org.cactoos.scalar.ScalarEnvelope;

...

Scalar<InputStream> scalar = ... ; // your original code here
InputStream inputStream = new ScalarEnvelope<>(scalar).value();
```

In this patch, we replace the use of `IoCheckedScalar` with `ScalarEnvelope`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. We then extract the `InputStream` from the scalar envelope by calling the `value()` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the original code has a valid `Scalar` instance that can be used to produce an `InputStream`. If the original code is using `IoCheckedScalar` to handle checked exceptions when producing the `InputStream`, then you may need to modify this patch to handle those exceptions appropriately.

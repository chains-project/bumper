Here is the proposed patch:
```java
import org.cactoos.io.Joined;

...

public Iterable<Byte[]> walletsBytes(Iterable<Wallet> wallets) throws IOException {
  return new IterableOfBytes(new Joined<>(
    wallet -> new BytesOf(wallet.title()),
    wallets
  ));
}
```
Explanation:
The `JoinedText` class has been removed in the new library version, so we need to replace it with an alternative. The new version includes a `Joined` class in the `org.cactoos.io` package, which can be used to concatenate the bytes of multiple `Wallet` objects.
To use this class, we need to first convert each `Wallet` object to a `Byte[]` using the `BytesOf` class. We can then pass an iterator of these byte arrays to the `Joined` constructor, along with a function that converts each `Wallet` to a `Byte[]`. Finally, we can convert the resulting `Joined` object to an `IterableOfBytes` to match the return type of the method.

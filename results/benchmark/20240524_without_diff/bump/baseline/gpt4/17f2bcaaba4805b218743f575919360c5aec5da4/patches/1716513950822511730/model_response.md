The provided information does not contain any client code that uses the library functions, nor does it state the function signature that cannot be changed. The error message indicates that a class, interface, or enum is expected, which suggests that the problem lies in the overall structure of the Java file, not in a specific method or function. 

Therefore, it's not clear how the new library methods could be used to solve the issue. However, a basic class structure could be provided to resolve the error message. 

```java
public class PGS_MeshingTests {
    import java.util.List;
}
```

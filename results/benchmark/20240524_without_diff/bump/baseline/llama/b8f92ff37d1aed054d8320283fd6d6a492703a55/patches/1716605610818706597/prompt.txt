Act as an Automatic Program Repair (APR) tool, reply only with code, without explanation.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.

the following client code fails:
```java
  /**
	 * Computes if a given class is to be included in the post-coverage computation
	 *
	 * If we have include-exclude patterns for Jacoco:
	 * - We include the class if it matches the include patterns and does not match the excludes patterns
	 * Else:
	 * - We include the class if it is available in the binary directories
	 * @param className
	 * @return true if the class should be included in the coverage result, false otherwise
	 */
    private boolean classToInclude(String className) {
        // False if it matches an excludes pattern
        for (String pattern : config.getJacocoExcludes()) {
            WildcardMatcher matcher = new WildcardMatcher(pattern);
            if (matcher.matches(className)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        // True if it matches an includes pattern and doesn't match any excludes pattern
        for (String pattern : config.getJacocoIncludes()) {
            WildcardMatcher matcher = new WildcardMatcher(pattern);
            if (matcher.matches(className)) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        // True if it is present in the available binaries
        for (String dir : config.getBinJavaDir()) {
            DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(new File(dir), TestListResolver.getWildcard());
            if (directoryScanner.scan().getClasses().contains(className)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        for (String dir : config.getBinTestDir()) {
            DirectoryScanner directoryScanner = new DirectoryScanner(new File(dir), TestListResolver.getWildcard());
            if (directoryScanner.scan().getClasses().contains(className)) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
```

with the following error message:
[ERROR] /flacoco/src/main/java/fr/spoonlabs/flacoco/core/coverage/CoverageMatrix.java:[199,101] cannot find symbol

propose a patch that I can apply to the code in order to fix the error.
Your response will be automatically parsed by an algorithm, be sure to only return the code.
be sure to return a code segment that can replace the entire failing client code.
you CANNOT change the function signature, but you can create variables if they help to make the code easier to understand.
you CAN remove the Override decorator IF AND ONLY IF the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
you CANNOT use removed library methods identified with `--`, but you CAN use added library methods identified with `++`.
DO NOT USE '--' or '++' to indicate changes you make on the code, be sure to return only code that can be compiled.
return only the fixed failing method, not the complete class code, you MUST change something in the code.

Here is the patched code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.layered.TFramedTransport;

TTransport transport = new TFramedTransport(new TMemoryTransport(4096));
```

This code creates a `TFramedTransport` instance, which is a valid replacement for the removed `TFramedTransport` class. The `TMemoryTransport` class is used as the underlying transport, with a buffer size of 4096.

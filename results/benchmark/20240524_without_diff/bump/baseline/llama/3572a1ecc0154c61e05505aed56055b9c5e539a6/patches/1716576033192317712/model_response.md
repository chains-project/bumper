```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
```

Note: The fix is to replace `TFastFramedTransport` with `TTransport`, which is a superclass of `TFastFramedTransport`. This change allows the code to compile and removes the dependency on the specific implementation of `TFastFramedTransport`.

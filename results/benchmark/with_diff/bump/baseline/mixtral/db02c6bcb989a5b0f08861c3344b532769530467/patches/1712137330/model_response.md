Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(strings = {
        "",
        ".0",
        "*",
        "\u00ea",
        "-my-tag",
        //@checkstyle LineLengthCheck (1 line)
        "012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678"
    })
    void shouldFailToGetValueWhenInvalid(final String original) {
        final Tag.Valid tag = new Tag.Valid(original);
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(tag.valid(), new IsEqual<>(false));
        final InvalidTagNameException exception = Assertions.assertThrows(
            InvalidTagNameException.class,
            tag::value
        );
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(
            exception.getMessage(),
            new AllOf<>(
                Arrays.asList(
                    new StringStartsWith("Invalid tag"),
                    new StringContains(original)
                )
            )
        );
    }
```
The changes I made are:

1. I replaced the `StringContains` matcher with `StringStartsWith` for the first argument of `AllOf`, because the `StringContains` constructor that takes a boolean and a string was removed in the new library version.
2. I removed the `true` argument from the `StringContains` matcher, because it is not needed and was causing the compilation error.
3. I changed the name of the exception variable from `throwable` to `exception`, because it is more descriptive and follows common naming conventions.

Note that the `Override` decorator is not removed, because the method is still overriding a method in the new version. Also, no removed library methods are used, and no new library methods are introduced.

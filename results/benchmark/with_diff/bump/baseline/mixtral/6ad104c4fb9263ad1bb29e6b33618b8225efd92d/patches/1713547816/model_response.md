Here is a possible patch for the failing method in the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

//...

@Override
public void decodeMessage(ByteBuffer buffer, int length) throws IOException {
    //...
    try {
        TlsFatalAlert fatalAlert = new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.decode(buffer));
        //...
    } catch (TlsFatalAlert fatalAlert) {
        //...
    }
    //...
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `TlsFatalAlert` using the `AlertDescription.decode` method, which is a new method added in the updated library version. This replaces the use of the removed constructor `TlsFatalAlert(short)`. The `TlsFatalAlert` object is then used in the same way as before.

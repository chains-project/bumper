Sure, here's a possible patch for the failing method in `ChachaDecoder.java`:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsUtils;

// ...

@Override
public void fail(String message) {
    super.fail(TlsUtils.alertDescription(TlsFatalAlert.INTERNAL_ERROR, message));
}
```
In this patch, we've imported the `TlsUtils` class from the Bouncy Castle library, which provides some utility methods for working with TLS alerts. We've then replaced the call to `super.fail(message)` with a call to `super.fail(TlsUtils.alertDescription(TlsFatalAlert.INTERNAL_ERROR, message))`. This new call creates a `TlsFatalAlert` object with the `INTERNAL_ERROR` alert level and the given message, and then passes it to the `fail` method of the superclass.

Note that we've used the `TlsFatalAlert` constructor that takes a short alert level as its argument, which is an added method in the new library version. We've also used the `TlsUtils.alertDescription` method to create a `TlsFatalAlert` object from an alert level and a description string, which is a method that's available in both the old and new library versions.

With this patch, the `fail` method should work with both the old and new versions of the Bouncy Castle library.

Here is a possible patch for the failing method in the client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

// ...

@Override
public void decode(ChannelBuffer channelBuffer) throws IOException {
    short type = channelBuffer.readShort();
    short length = channelBuffer.readShort();
    if (length < 0) {
        throw new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.decode(type));
    }
    // ...
}
```
The patch imports the new `TlsFatalAlert` class from the updated library version, and uses it to throw a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance in the `decode` method.

Note that the `decode` method is not overriding any method in the new version, so the `@Override` decorator can be safely removed.

The `AlertDescription.decode` method is still available in the new library version, so it can be used to decode the `type` parameter.

This patch should fix the error caused by the missing `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert` class in the updated library version.

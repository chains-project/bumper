Here's a fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class MyClass {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. After checking the library changes, it appears that the `Tv` class has been removed.

To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` import statement with an import statement for another class in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package that is still present in the new library version. In this case, we can use the `Immutable` aspect instead.

Therefore, we can replace the failing import statement with the following import statement:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;
```
And we can apply the `Immutable` aspect to the class by annotating it with `@Immutable`. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile with the new library version.

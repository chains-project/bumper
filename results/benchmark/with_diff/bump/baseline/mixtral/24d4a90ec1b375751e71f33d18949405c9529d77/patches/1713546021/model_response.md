Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In the updated library version, the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced with the `Loggable` aspect. By annotating the class with `@Loggable`, we can achieve similar functionality to what was previously provided by the `Tv` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the functionality provided by the `Tv` class is not needed in the `AwsOcketITCase` class. If the `Tv` class was used for some specific functionality that is not provided by the `Loggable` aspect, then a different solution may be necessary.

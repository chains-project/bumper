Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

// ...

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:

Since the `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, we can no longer use it. However, the error message indicates that the original code is part of a test case. In this context, logging the execution of the test method can be helpful for debugging purposes.

The `Loggable` aspect from the same package can be used to log the execution of the test method. By annotating the test class with `@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)`, we can log the execution of all test methods in the class at the DEBUG level. This should provide sufficient information for debugging any issues that may arise during testing.

Note that the `Override` decorator has been removed since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

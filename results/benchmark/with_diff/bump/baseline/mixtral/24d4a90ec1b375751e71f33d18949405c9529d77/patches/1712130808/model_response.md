Sure, here's a potential fix for the failing code:

```java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomUtils;

// ...

@Test
@DisplayName("testPutObject")
public void testPutObject() throws Exception {
    String content = RandomUtils.randomAlphanumeric(10);
    // ...
}
```

In this fix, we've replaced the usage of `RandomStringUtils` with `RandomUtils`, which is a new class added in the updated version of the library. We've also changed the import statement accordingly.

Note that this fix assumes that the rest of the code in the method is unchanged and still valid. If there are any other issues with the code, they will need to be addressed separately.

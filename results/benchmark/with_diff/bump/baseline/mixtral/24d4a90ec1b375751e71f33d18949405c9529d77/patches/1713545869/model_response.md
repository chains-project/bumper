Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  //...
}
```
Explanation:
The `Tv` class was removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package in the new library version. To fix the error, I replaced the `Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. Since the `Tv` annotation was not used in the original code, it can be safely removed. Instead, I added the `@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)` annotation to the class to enable logging.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
In the updated library version, the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced with a `Loggable` aspect. To fix the error, we can replace the `Tv` import statement with an import for `Loggable`, and add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class. Note that the `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect, so the overall behavior of the code should be similar.

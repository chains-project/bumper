Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. After checking the library changes, we can see that the `Tv` class has been removed. However, the `Loggable` aspect is still present in the new version of the library. We can use this aspect to replace the `Tv` aspect, and achieve similar functionality.

To use the `Loggable` aspect, we need to add the `com.jcabi.aspects` import statement at the beginning of the file. Then, we can annotate the class with `@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)` to enable debug logging. This will log the method entries and exits, similar to the `Tv` aspect.

Note that we had to remove the `@Override` decorator from the `testS3Url()` method, as it is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

// ...

@Immutable
@Tv("1.0")
```
In this patch, I replaced the problematic import statement with the correct one (`com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable`) and added the `@Immutable` annotation to the class. Additionally, I added the `@Tv` annotation to specify the version of the class. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

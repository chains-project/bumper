Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. After checking the library changes, I noticed that the `Tv` class has been removed. However, the `Loggable` aspect can be used as an alternative. I added the `@Loggable` annotation with the `DEBUG` level to the class, which should provide similar functionality to the original `Tv` aspect.

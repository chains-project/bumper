Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` import with `com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable`. The `Tv` aspect seems to have been removed from the library, but the `Loggable` aspect still exists. By using `Loggable`, we can still apply aspects to the class, even if it's not exactly the same aspect as before.

Note that the `@Loggable` annotation may need to be added to each method in the class that was previously annotated with `@Tv`. If the methods in question do not need to be annotated with any aspect, the annotation can be removed entirely.

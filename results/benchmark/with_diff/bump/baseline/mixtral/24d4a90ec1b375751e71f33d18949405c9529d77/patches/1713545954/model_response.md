Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. After checking the library changes, I noticed that the `Tv` class has been removed in the new version. Instead, we can use the `Loggable` aspect to achieve similar functionality. By adding the `@Loggable` annotation with the `Loggable.DEBUG` level, we can log debug messages using the built-in logging mechanism provided by the library. This should resolve the error without modifying the function signature or using removed library methods.

Here's the fixed version of the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```
I've replaced the `Tv` import with `Loggable` from the same package `com.jcabi.aspects`. Since the error message indicates a missing `Tv` symbol, it's likely that `Tv` is no longer a part of the library. By using `Loggable` instead, the code should work with the new library version.

Here's a patch that should fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class AwsOcketITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a replacement for the removed `Tv` aspect. The `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality by logging the method's execution time. The `@Loggable` annotation takes a log level as an argument, which can be set to `DEBUG`, `INFO`, or `WARN`. In this example, I set it to `DEBUG`.

Note that the `Loggable` aspect is not a drop-in replacement for the `Tv` aspect, so you may need to adjust the code accordingly. However, this should fix the compilation error you're encountering.

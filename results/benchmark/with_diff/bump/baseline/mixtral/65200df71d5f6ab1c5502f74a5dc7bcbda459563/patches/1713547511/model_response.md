Here's the proposed patch:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepository = GlobalConfiguration.getLanguageSupportRepository();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setEnabledLanguages(languageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode())
            .build();
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `addEnabledLanguages` method is no longer available in the new version of the library. Instead, the `setEnabledLanguages` method can be used to set the enabled languages.

To get the enabled languages, we can use the `LanguageSupportRepository` class, which has two methods for getting the enabled languages: `getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode` and `getEnabledLanguagesInStandaloneMode`. We can choose the appropriate method based on the use case. In this case, we use `getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode` to get the enabled languages.

We also remove the call to `globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages()` since it is no longer needed. We also remove the `@Override` decorator since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepository = GlobalRepositoryStorage.instance().get(GlobalRepositoryStorage.Type.LANGUAGE_SUPPORT);
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setEnabledLanguages(languageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode())
            .build();
}
```
In this patch, we first retrieve the `LanguageSupportRepository` instance from the global repository storage. This repository provides the necessary methods to get the enabled languages in connected mode, which is equivalent to the old `getEnabledLanguages()` method.

Then, we build the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration` by setting the client pid, extra properties, work directory, modules provider, and the enabled languages from the `LanguageSupportRepository`.

Note that we had to remove the call to `addEnabledLanguages()` because it is no longer available in the new version of the library. Instead, we set the enabled languages directly using the new method `setEnabledLanguages()`.

Also note that we had to remove the `@Override` decorator because the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Finally, we return the built `AnalysisEngineConfiguration`.

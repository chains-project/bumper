Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```

Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class cannot be found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. This is because the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed in the new library version. Instead, the `FramedTransport` class should be used, which provides the same functionality as the `TFramedTransport` class. By importing the `FramedTransport` class and creating an instance of it, the error can be resolved.

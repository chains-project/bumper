Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```
Note that I changed the import statement to use the new name of the class (`FramedTransport`), and created a new variable `transport` of type `TFramedTransport` to hold an instance of the new class.

This code should compile against the new version of the library. Let me know if you have any questions!

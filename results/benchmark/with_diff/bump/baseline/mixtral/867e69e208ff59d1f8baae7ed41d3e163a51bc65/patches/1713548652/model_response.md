Here's the fixed version of the method that should resolve the error:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TFramedTransport;

public class SimpleThriftLogger {
  // ...

  @Override
  public void startTransport(TTransport transport) {
    if (transport instanceof TFramedTransport) {
      TFramedTransport framedTransport = (TFramedTransport) transport;
      framedTransport.open();
    } else {
      transport.open();
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

The only change here is the import statement for `TFramedTransport`. I added the import for `TTransport` to make it explicit, but it might already be imported in your code.

The reason for this change is that in the new version of the library, `TFramedTransport` is no longer directly available in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. Instead, you need to import `TTransport` and cast the received transport to `TFramedTransport` if it's an instance of it.

This solution assumes that you are using at least version 0.13.0 of the Apache Thrift library, as the change in the package structure was introduced in that version.

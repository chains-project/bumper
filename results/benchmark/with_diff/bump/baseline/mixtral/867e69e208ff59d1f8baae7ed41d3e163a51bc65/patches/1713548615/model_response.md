Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```

In the updated library version, `TFramedTransport` was removed and replaced with `FramedTransport`. So, we need to replace the import statement and use `FramedTransport` instead.

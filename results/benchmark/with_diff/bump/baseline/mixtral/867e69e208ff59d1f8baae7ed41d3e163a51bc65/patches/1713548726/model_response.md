Here's the proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.FramedTransport;

// ...

TFramedTransport transport = new FramedTransport(socket);
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class cannot be found. By checking the changes in the library version, we can see that `TFramedTransport` has been removed and replaced with `FramedTransport`. Therefore, we need to replace the import statement and update the code to use `FramedTransport` instead of `TFramedTransport`.

Since the `FramedTransport` class has the same constructor arguments as `TFramedTransport`, we can simply replace `TFramedTransport` with `FramedTransport` in the code.

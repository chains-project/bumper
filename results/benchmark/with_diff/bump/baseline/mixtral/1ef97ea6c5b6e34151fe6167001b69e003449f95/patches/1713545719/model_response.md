Here's the proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This code should be replaced with the following:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    Timestamp fromTS = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    Timestamp toTS = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return super.between(fromTS, toTS);
}
```

The original code was using `Date` objects with the `Timestamp` constructor, which caused the incompatible types error. The updated code creates `Timestamp` objects from the original `Date` objects, and then passes those to the `super.between()` method, which should now work with the updated library.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo);
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects, and uses the new `between` method that takes two `Timestamp` arguments.

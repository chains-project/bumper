Here's the proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(to.getTime() - from.getTime());
}
```

In this patch, I changed the way the `Timestamp` object is created. Instead of using the `between` method from the external library, which now expects `java.sql.Timestamp` arguments, I calculated the difference between the two `Date` objects using their `getTime` method, which returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.000 GMT, and then created a new `Timestamp` object using this difference.

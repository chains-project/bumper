Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo).getTime());
}
```

This patch converts the `java.util.Date` objects to `java.sql.Timestamp` before calling the `between` method of the external library. It does this by creating new `Timestamp` objects using the `Date` objects' time values. The method then calls the library's `between` method with the new `Timestamp` objects, which should resolve the type incompatibility error.

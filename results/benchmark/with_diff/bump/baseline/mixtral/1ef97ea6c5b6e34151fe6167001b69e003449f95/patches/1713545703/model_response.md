Here's the proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This patch should fix the error by converting the `Date` objects returned by `super.between(from, to)` to `Timestamp` objects. However, this patch may still fail if the superclass's `between` method no longer accepts `Date` objects as arguments. In that case, you may need to modify the superclass or find a different way to implement the `between` method.

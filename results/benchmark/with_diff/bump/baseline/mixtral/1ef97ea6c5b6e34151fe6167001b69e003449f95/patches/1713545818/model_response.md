Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo).getTime());
}
```

The changes made include:

* Creating two new variables `sqlFrom` and `sqlTo` of type `java.sql.Timestamp` to store the converted `Date` objects.
* Using the new `between` method of the library that accepts `java.sql.Timestamp` objects.
* Converting the result of `super.between` back to a `java.sql.Timestamp` object.

This patch ensures that the code can work with the new version of the library.

Based on the error message and the library changes, it seems that the `between` method of the external dependency now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. Therefore, you can fix the error by changing the return type of the `between` method in the client code to `java.sql.Timestamp`. Here's the fixed code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
However, since the `between` method of the superclass now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp`, you can simplify the code by removing the explicit conversion to `Timestamp`. Here's the simplified code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  return super.between(from, to);
}
```
Note that this code assumes that the `between` method of the superclass now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object. If this assumption is incorrect, then you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    Timestamp fromTS = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    Timestamp toTS = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(fromTS, toTS).getTime());
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before passing them to the `between` method of the superclass. This is necessary because the updated library now only accepts `Timestamp` objects for the `between` method.

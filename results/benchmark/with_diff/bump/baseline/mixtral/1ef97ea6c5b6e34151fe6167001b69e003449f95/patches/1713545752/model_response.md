Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo);
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` and uses the new library method `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(java.sql.Timestamp, java.sql.Timestamp)` to calculate the difference between the two timestamps.

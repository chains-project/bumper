Here's the proposed patch for the failing code:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This patch should fix the error by converting the `Date` objects returned by the superclass's `between` method to `Timestamp` objects using the `Timestamp` constructor that takes a `long` argument.

Note that this patch assumes that the superclass's `between` method still returns a `Date` object in the new library version. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be modified accordingly.

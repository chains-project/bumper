Here's the proposed patch for the given failing code:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

Change to:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    LocalDateTime fromLdt = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(from.toInstant(), java.time.ZoneId.systemDefault());
    LocalDateTime toLdt = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(to.toInstant(), java.time.ZoneId.systemDefault());
    long millisBetween = java.time.Duration.between(fromLdt, toLdt).toMillis();
    return new Timestamp(millisBetween);
}
```

The original code uses the `between` method from the superclass, which returns a `Date` object. However, the updated library version no longer includes the `between` method that returns a `Date`. To resolve this issue, the code has been updated to use the `LocalDateTime` class from the `java.time` package to calculate the difference between the two dates in milliseconds and then create a new `Timestamp` object.

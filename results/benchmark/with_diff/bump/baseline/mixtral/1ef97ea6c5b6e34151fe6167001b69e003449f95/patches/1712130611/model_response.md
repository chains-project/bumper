Based on the error message and the library changes, it seems that the `between` method of the external dependency now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. Therefore, you can fix the error by changing the return type of the `between` method in the client code to `java.sql.Timestamp`. Here's the fixed code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
However, since `Date.getTime()` returns a `long` value representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, you need to convert this value to a `java.sql.Timestamp` using the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor. Here's the updated code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
  return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
Note that this code still uses the deprecated `Date.getTime()` method, but since the `Date` class itself is not deprecated and the method is still supported, it should be fine for now. However, you may want to consider updating the code to use the `java.time` package instead of the deprecated `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Timestamp` classes in the future.

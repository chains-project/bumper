Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

Looking at the changes in the library, we can see that the `Loggable` aspect has been added, which provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect. We can use the `Loggable` aspect instead of the `Tv` aspect to fix the error.

To use the `Loggable` aspect, we need to import it and apply it to the `MkGithub` class using the `@Loggable` annotation. We can also specify the logging level using the `Loggable.DEBUG` constant.

This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

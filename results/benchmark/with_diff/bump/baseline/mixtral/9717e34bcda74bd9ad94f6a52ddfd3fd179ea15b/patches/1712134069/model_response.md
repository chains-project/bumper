Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In the new library version, the `Tv` class has been removed from `com.jcabi.aspects`. Instead, we can use the `Loggable` aspect to achieve similar functionality. By annotating the `MkGithub` class with `@Loggable`, the class will automatically have a logger injected into it. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error caused by the missing `Tv` class.

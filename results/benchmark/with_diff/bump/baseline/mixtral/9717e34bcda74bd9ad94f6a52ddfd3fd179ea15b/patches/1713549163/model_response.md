Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

Looking at the changes in the library version, we can see that the `Loggable` aspect has been added to the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We can use this aspect to replace the functionality of the `Tv` class.

To do this, we can import the `Loggable` aspect and apply it to the `MkGithub` class using the `@Loggable` annotation. We can set the log level to `DEBUG` to get similar behavior to the `Tv` class.

This patch should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run with the new library version.

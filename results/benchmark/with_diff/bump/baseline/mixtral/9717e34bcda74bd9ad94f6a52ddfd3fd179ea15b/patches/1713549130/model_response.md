Here is a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `Tv` class is not found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

To fix the error, we need to remove the import statement for `Tv` and find an alternative way to implement the functionality that was using `Tv`.

In this case, it looks like the `MkGithub` class was using the `Tv` class to log debug messages. We can replace the `Tv` class with the `Loggable` aspect, which provides similar functionality.

To use `Loggable`, we need to import it and add the `@Loggable` annotation to the `MkGithub` class. We can also specify the logging level as `DEBUG` to match the behavior of `Tv`.

With these changes, the `MkGithub` class should compile and run without errors.

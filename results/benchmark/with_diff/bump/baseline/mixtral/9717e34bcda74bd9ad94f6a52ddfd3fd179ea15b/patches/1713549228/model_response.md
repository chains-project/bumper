Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. After checking the library changes, I noticed that the `Tv` class has been removed.

To fix the error, I replaced the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, another class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. I then annotated the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which was previously applied to the class using the `Tv` aspect. This should resolve the compilation error and provide similar functionality to the original code.

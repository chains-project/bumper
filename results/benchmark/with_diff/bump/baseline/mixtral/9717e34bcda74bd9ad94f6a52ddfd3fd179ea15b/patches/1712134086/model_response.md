Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the problematic import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, which is a new class added in the updated library version. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which was previously applied to the class using the `Tv` aspect.

Note that this patch assumes that the behavior of the original code can be replicated using the new `Loggable` aspect. If this is not the case, further modifications to the code may be necessary.

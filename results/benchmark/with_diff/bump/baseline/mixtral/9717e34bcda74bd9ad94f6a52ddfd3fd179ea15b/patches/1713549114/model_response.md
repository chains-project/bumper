Here's a possible patch for the client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we remove the problematic import statement for `Tv` and replace it with an import statement for `Loggable`. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with `@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)` to enable logging for the class.

Note that the `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to the `Tv` aspect, so this patch should allow the client code to continue functioning as intended. Additionally, since `Loggable` is a new method added in the updated library version, we can safely use it in the client code.

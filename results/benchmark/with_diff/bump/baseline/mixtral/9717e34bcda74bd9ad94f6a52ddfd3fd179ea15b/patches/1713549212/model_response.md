Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`. I then added the `@Loggable` annotation to the class definition, using the `Loggable.DEBUG` level. This should fix the error by using an added library method (`Loggable`) instead of the removed method (`Tv`).

Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. After checking the library changes, I noticed that the `Tv` class has been removed. However, the `Loggable` aspect can be used instead. By adding the `@Loggable` annotation, the class will have a `log()` method generated, which can be used for debugging purposes. This should fix the error without modifying the function signature or using removed library methods.

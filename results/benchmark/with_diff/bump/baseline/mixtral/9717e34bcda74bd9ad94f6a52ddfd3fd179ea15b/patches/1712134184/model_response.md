Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the problematic import statement with a new one that imports the `Loggable` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We then annotate the `MkGithub` class with the `@Loggable` annotation, which is a replacement for the removed `Tv` aspect. The `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to `Tv`, but with a different name and possibly a different implementation.

Note that the `Loggable` aspect takes a parameter of type `int`, which specifies the logging level. In this patch, we set the logging level to `DEBUG`, but you can adjust this value based on your specific needs.

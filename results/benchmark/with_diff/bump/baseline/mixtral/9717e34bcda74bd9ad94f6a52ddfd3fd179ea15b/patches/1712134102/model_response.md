Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a new addition in the library. The `Loggable` aspect provides similar functionality to `Tv` by logging the method execution time. Note that the `@Override` annotation is removed since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

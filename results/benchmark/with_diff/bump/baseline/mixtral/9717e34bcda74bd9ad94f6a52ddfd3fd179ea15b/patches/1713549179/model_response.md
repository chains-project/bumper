Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the symbol `Tv` cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This suggests that the `Tv` class has been removed from the library.

Looking at the library changes, we can see that the `Loggable` aspect has been added. We can use this aspect to replace the functionality of the `Tv` aspect.

To do this, we can simply replace the `import` statement for `Tv` with an `import` statement for `Loggable`. We also need to annotate the class with `@Loggable` and specify the logging level. In this case, we have used `Loggable.DEBUG`, but you can adjust the logging level as needed.

Note that we have not changed the function signature or removed the `@Override` decorator, as these are not necessary to fix the error. We have also not used any removed library methods, and have only used the added `Loggable` aspect.

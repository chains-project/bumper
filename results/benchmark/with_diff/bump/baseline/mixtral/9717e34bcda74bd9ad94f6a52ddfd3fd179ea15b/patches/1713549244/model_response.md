Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```

This patch removes the failed import statement and replaces it with a new import statement for the `Loggable` class from the same package. The `Tv` class has been removed from the library, so it can't be used. Instead, I've added the `Loggable` annotation to the `MkGithub` class, which can be used to log debug messages. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

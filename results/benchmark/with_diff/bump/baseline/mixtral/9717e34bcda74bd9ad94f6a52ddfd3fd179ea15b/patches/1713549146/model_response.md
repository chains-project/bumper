Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class MkGithub {
    // existing code...
}
```
In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed from `com.jcabi.aspects` package. Instead, we can use the `Loggable` aspect to achieve similar functionality. I have removed the import statement for `Tv` and added the `Loggable` aspect to the `MkGithub` class. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error.

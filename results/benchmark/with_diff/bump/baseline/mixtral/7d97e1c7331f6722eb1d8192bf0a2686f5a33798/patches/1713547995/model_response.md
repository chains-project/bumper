Here's a possible patch for the given client code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // ...
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a more appropriate choice for logging. I've also set the logging level to `DEBUG`. You can adjust the logging level as needed.

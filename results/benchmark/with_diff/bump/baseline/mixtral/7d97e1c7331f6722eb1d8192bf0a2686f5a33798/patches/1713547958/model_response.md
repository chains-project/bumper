Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

This patch replaces the `Tv` import with `Loggable` from the same package. The `Loggable` aspect is used to log method calls and can be a suitable replacement for the `Tv` aspect in this context.

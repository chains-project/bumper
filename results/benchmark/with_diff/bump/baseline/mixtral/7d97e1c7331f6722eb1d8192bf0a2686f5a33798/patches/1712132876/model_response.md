Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we've replaced the problematic import statement with a new import statement for the `Loggable` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. This should fix the error because `Loggable` is an added library method identified with `++`. Additionally, we've added the `@Loggable` decorator to the `RegionITCase` class. If the `@Override` decorator was not overriding any method in the new version, it can be safely removed.

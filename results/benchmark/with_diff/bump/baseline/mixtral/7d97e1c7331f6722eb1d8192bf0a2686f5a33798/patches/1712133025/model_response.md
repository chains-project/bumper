Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.Log.INFO)
public class RegionITCase {
  // ...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a new addition in the library. The `Loggable` aspect provides logging functionality, similar to the `Tv` aspect. We also add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class with the desired log level. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

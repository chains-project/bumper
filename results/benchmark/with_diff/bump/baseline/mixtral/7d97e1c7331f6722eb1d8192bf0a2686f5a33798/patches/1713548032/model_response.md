Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been removed. However, the `Loggable` aspect can be used as a replacement to provide similar functionality. By adding the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, logging will be enabled for all methods within the class. The `Loggable` aspect also supports various log levels, such as `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`. You can adjust the log level as needed to suit your specific use case.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In the updated library version, the `Tv` class has been removed and replaced with the `Loggable` aspect. To fix the error, replace the `import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;` line with `import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;` and add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class. In this case, the `Loggable.DEBUG` level is used, but you can adjust it as needed.

Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, we replace the import statement for `Tv` with an import statement for `Loggable`, another class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. We also add the `@Loggable` annotation to the class, which was previously annotated with `@Tv`. This should fix the error by using an added library method identified with `++`.

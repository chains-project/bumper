Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Immutable;

@Immutable
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `Tv` class is not found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. The class `Tv` has been removed in the new library version.

The `Immutable` annotation can be used as a replacement for the `Tv` annotation, as it provides similar functionality.

Note: This patch assumes that the `RegionITCase` class was previously annotated with `@Tv`. If that's not the case, a different solution may be required.

Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Loggable;

@Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
public class RegionITCase {
  // existing code...
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `Tv` aspect with the `Loggable` aspect, which is a new addition in the library. The `Loggable` aspect provides logging capabilities and can be used as a drop-in replacement for `Tv` in this case. Additionally, we set the logging level to `DEBUG` using the `Loggable.DEBUG` constant.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` aspect is not being used in the rest of the code. If it is, you may need to modify the code to use both `Tv` and `Loggable` aspects together, or find a different aspect that can replace `Tv` in a similar way.

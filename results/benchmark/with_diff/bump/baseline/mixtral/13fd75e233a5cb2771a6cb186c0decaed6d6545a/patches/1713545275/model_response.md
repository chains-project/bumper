Here's a possible patch for the given code:
```java
  @Override
  public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
      return this.delegate.matches(actual);
  }
```
The code above should still work as before, since the method signature has not been changed in the new library version.
The `Object` class has not been removed from Java, so the error message is likely caused by a different issue.
It's possible that the import statement for `java.lang.Object` is missing or incorrect in the client code.
To fix the issue, you can try adding the following import statement at the beginning of the file:
```java
import java.lang.Object;
```
If the issue persists, you may need to check if the new library version has any breaking changes that affect the client code.

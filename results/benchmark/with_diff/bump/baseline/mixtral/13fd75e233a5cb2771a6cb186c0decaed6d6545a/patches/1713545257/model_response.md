Here's the fixed version of the method:
```java
@Override
public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
    return this.delegate.matches(actual);
}
```
The code itself doesn't need any changes because it doesn't use any symbols from the external library. The error message is likely caused by a problem with the classpath or build configuration, so you should check that first. If the problem persists, you might need to update your test data or the way you're passing the `actual` argument to the method.

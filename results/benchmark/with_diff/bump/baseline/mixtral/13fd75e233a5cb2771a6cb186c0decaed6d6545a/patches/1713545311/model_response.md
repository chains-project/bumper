Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
    return this.delegate.matches(actual);
}
```

This code is identical to the original failing code. The error message indicates that the `Object` class cannot be found, which is a built-in Java class and should always be available. Therefore, the problem may be caused by a configuration issue or a problem with the external dependency, rather than an issue with the client code. As a result, no changes are needed in the client code.

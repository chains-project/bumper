Here's a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    StringContains contains = new StringContains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
    return contains;
}
```

This patch creates a new `StringContains` object and assigns it to a variable `contains`. This makes the code easier to read and understand. The `Matcher` object is then returned.

The `false` argument that was causing the compilation error has been removed since it was not necessary. The `StringContains` constructor only requires one argument, which is the expected substring.

Here's a fixed version of the code that should resolve the error:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
    return this.delegate.matches(actual);
}
```

The error message you provided indicates that the `Object` class cannot be found. However, the code you provided does not contain any references to the `Object` class, so it should not be causing this error.

Therefore, I suspect that the error is coming from a different part of your code that you have not provided. Nonetheless, I have provided the same code snippet back to you, since it is correct and does not contain any references to the `Object` class.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more context and code snippets so that I can better understand the problem and provide a more accurate solution.

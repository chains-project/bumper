Here's a possible patch for the given error:

```java
@Override
public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
    return this.delegate.matches(actual);
}
```

This code is identical to the original, but I'm assuming that the original code was working correctly with the previous version of the library. Therefore, the issue is likely caused by a change in the external dependency, rather than the client code itself.

In particular, the error message suggests that the `Object` class is no longer visible to the `IsErrorsResponse` class. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a change in the package structure or a missing import statement.

However, without access to the full codebase or the updated library version, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. Therefore, I've opted to provide the original code as a patch, which should work as long as the external dependency is fixed.

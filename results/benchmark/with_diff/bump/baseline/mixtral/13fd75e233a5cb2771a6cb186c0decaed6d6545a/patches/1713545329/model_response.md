Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
    return this.delegate.matches(actual);
}
```
This patch should fix the error because it does not use any symbols or methods that have been removed in the new library version. It only uses the `Object` class, which is part of the Java standard library and should not be affected by changes in the external dependency.

However, it is possible that the failure is caused by a change in the behavior or signature of the `delegate.matches()` method. In that case, you may need to modify the code inside the method to adapt to the new version of the library. Without more information about the changes in the library, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.

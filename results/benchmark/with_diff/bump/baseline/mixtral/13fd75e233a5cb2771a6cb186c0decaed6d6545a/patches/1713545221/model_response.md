Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:
```java
@Override
public boolean matches(final Object actual) {
    return this.delegate.matches(actual);
}
```
The code doesn't need any changes, as it doesn't use any removed symbols or methods. The error message is misleading, and the actual issue might be caused by a missing import statement or a problem with the external dependency.

You can try adding the following import statement at the beginning of the file:
```java
import java.lang.Object;
```
If the issue persists, you might want to double-check the external dependency configuration and make sure it's compatible with the new library version.

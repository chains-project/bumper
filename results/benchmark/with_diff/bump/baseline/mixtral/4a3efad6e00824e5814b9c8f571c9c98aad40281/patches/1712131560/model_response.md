I cannot directly see the code, but I can provide a possible fix for the issue you described. Based on the information provided, it seems that the `CertificationPermission` class is no longer available in the updated dependency. If that's the case, you might need to refactor the code to remove any usage of `CertificationPermission`.

Here's a potential fix for the failing method. I'm assuming the method is something like this:

```java
@Override
public void signPdf(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath, List<X509Certificate> certificates, String reason, String location) throws Exception {
    PdfSigningParameters signingParameters = new PdfSigningParameters();
    CertificationPermission permission = new CertificationPermission(CertificationPermission.CERTIFICATION_ALL);
    signingParameters.setCertificationPermission(permission);
    // ... other code ...
}
```

To fix the issue, you can remove the `CertificationPermission` and set the certification permission directly:

```java
@Override
public void signPdf(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath, List<X509Certificate> certificates, String reason, String location) throws Exception {
    PdfSigningParameters signingParameters = new PdfSigningParameters();
    signingParameters.setCertificationLevel(PdfSigningParameters.CERTIFICATION_LEVEL_ALL);
    // ... other code ...
}
```

This solution assumes that you can directly set the certification level without using `CertificationPermission`. If the library doesn't support this behavior, you may need to find an alternative solution or use a different version of the library that still supports the `CertificationPermission` class.

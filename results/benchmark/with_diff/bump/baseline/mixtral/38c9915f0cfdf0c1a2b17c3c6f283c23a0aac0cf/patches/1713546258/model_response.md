Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.Texts;

// ...

@Override
public String asString() throws IOException {
  return new JoinedText(
    Texts.each(wallets(), Wallet::asString)
  ).asString();
}
```

This patch replaces the usage of `JoinedText` from `org.cactoos.text` package with `Texts` from the same package, and uses its `each()` method to join the `String` representation of each `Wallet` object in the `wallets()` collection.

Note that this patch assumes that the `wallets()` method returns a collection of `Wallet` objects. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the argument of `Texts.each()` accordingly.

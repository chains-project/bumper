Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.Texts;

//...

@Override
public String asJson(WalletId id) throws IOException {
  List<String> parts = new ArrayList<>();
  for (Wallet wallet : wallets(id)) {
    parts.add(asJson(wallet));
  }
  return new JoinedText(Texts.splitBy("\n"), parts).asString();
}
```
In this patch, we replaced the import statement for `JoinedText` with an import for `Texts`, which is a new class in the updated library that provides similar functionality. We then used the `Texts.splitBy("\n")` method to split a string into lines, which is similar to the `JoinedText` constructor that takes a delimiter. Finally, we used the `asString()` method to convert the `JoinedText` object back to a string.

Note that the `JoinedText` class has been removed in the updated library, so we cannot use it directly. However, we can still achieve the same functionality using the `Texts` class and the `splitBy()` method.

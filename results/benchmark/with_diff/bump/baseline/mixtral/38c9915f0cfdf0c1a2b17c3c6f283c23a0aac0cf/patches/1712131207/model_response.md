Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextCollector;

// ...

@Override
public String asString() throws IOException {
  return new TextCollector(
    input -> new JoinedText(
      Iterables.values(input)
    )
  ).toString(addresses);
}
```

Explanation:

The `JoinedText` class has been removed in the new library version, but the `TextCollector` class can be used instead. It collects a list of `Text` objects and joins them into a single `Text` object. By passing `Iterables.values(input)` to `TextCollector`, we can convert the `Iterable` of `Address` objects to a list of `Text` objects.

Note: The `TextCollector` class was added in the new library version, so it can be used safely.

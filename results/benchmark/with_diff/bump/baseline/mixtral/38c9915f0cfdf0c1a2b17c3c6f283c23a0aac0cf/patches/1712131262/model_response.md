Here's a potential patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.cactoos.text.TextEnvelope;
import org.cactoos.text.TextOf;

// ...

@Override
public String text() {
  return new TextEnvelope(
    new JoinedText(
      new TextOf(api().wallets())
    ),
    "["
  ).asString();
}
```

This patch replaces the failed import statement with the correct one, and uses the `TextEnvelope` and `TextOf` classes from the updated library version to construct a `JoinedText` object. The `TextEnvelope` class is used to add square brackets around the joined text. The `TextOf` class is used to convert the list of wallets to a `Text` object. The `asString` method is called on the `TextEnvelope` object to convert it to a string.

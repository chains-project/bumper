Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

public class MyClass {
    private final Yaml yaml;

    public MyClass() {
        this.yaml = new Yaml(createTrustedTagInspector());
    }

    private TrustedTagInspector createTrustedTagInspector() {
        return new TrustedTagInspector() {
            @Override
            public boolean isGlobalTagAllowed(Tag tag) {
                // Implement the logic you need here
                return false;
            }
        };
    }
}
```
Explanation:
Since the `TrustedTagInspector` constructor is no longer available in the new library version, we can't directly instantiate it. Instead, we create an anonymous inner class that extends `TrustedTagInspector` and provides an implementation for the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method.
We then pass an instance of this inner class to the `Yaml` constructor.
Note that the `Override` decorator is still present because the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method is being overridden. However, if the method is not actually overriding any method in the new version, you can safely remove the `Override` decorator.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.nodes.Tag;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml;

// ...

public TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();

// ...

@Override
public void testSomething() {
    Yaml yaml = new Yaml(trustedTagInspector);
    // ...
}
```
Explanation:
The `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed in the new library version, so we cannot use it directly. However, the `Yaml` class still has a constructor that takes a `Tag` filter as an argument. We can create an instance of `TrustedTagInspector` and pass it to the `Yaml` constructor to achieve the same effect.

Note: I assumed that the `testSomething` method is the one that is failing, and that it uses the `TrustedTagInspector` to create a `Yaml` instance. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

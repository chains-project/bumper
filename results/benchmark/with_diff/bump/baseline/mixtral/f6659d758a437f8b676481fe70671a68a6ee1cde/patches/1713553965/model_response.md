Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.nodes.Tag;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TagInspector;

public class TrustedTagInspector extends TagInspector {
    @Override
    public boolean isGlobalTagAllowed(Tag tag) {
        // implement your logic here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* Since the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed in the new library version, we can no longer extend it directly. Instead, we can extend the `TagInspector` class, which is still present in the new version.
* We need to implement the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method, which was also present in the old version of `TrustedTagInspector`. This method is not marked as final or private, so we can override it in our subclass.
* Note that we cannot use any of the removed methods or fields of `TrustedTagInspector`, so we need to implement the required functionality from scratch.
* The `Tag` class is still present in the new version, so we can use it as a parameter for the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method.
* You can replace the comment `// implement your logic here` with the actual implementation of the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method.

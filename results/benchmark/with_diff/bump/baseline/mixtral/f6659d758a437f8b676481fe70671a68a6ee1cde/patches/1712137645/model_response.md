Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.nodes.Tag;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TagInspector;

public class TrustedTagInspectorImpl implements TagInspector {
    @Override
    public boolean isGlobalTagAllowed(Tag tag) {
        // Implement the logic for checking if the global tag is allowed here
        // For example:
        return tag.getValue().startsWith("!global");
    }
}

// Replace the following line:
// import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;
import TrustedTagInspectorImpl;
```
Explanation:

Since the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed in the new library version, we need to replace its usage with a custom implementation that provides the same functionality.

In this patch, we create a new class `TrustedTagInspectorImpl` that implements the `TagInspector` interface, which is a replacement for the removed `TrustedTagInspector` class. We then override the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method to provide the same functionality as the removed method.

Finally, we replace the `import` statement for `TrustedTagInspector` with an import statement for our custom implementation.

Note that we cannot simply remove the `@Override` decorator from the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method, since it is still overriding a method in the `TagInspector` interface. Therefore, we need to keep the decorator and provide a valid implementation for the method.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.nodes.Tag;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TagInspector;

public class TrustedTagInspector extends TagInspector {
    @Override
    public boolean isGlobalTagAllowed(Tag tag) {
        // implement your logic here
    }
}
```
Explanation:
The `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed in the new library version, so we cannot directly import it anymore. However, the `TagInspector` class, which `TrustedTagInspector` extended, is still present. Therefore, we can create our own `TrustedTagInspector` class that extends `TagInspector` and overrides the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method, which was also present in the original `TrustedTagInspector` class.

Note that the `@Override` annotation is optional here, but it can help catch potential bugs if the method signature changes in future library versions.

Of course, you will need to implement the logic of the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method yourself, based on your specific use case.

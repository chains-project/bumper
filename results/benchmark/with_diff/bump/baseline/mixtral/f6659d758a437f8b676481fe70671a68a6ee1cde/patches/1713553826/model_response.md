Here's a possible patch for the client code to fix the error:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.nodes.Tag;
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TagInspector;

public class TrustedTagInspectorImpl implements TagInspector {
    @Override
    public boolean isGlobalTagAllowed(Tag tag) {
        // Implement your logic here
        return true;
    }
}

// Usage
TagInspector inspector = new TrustedTagInspectorImpl();
```
Explanation:

* Since the `TrustedTagInspector` class has been removed, we can no longer directly extend it.
* Instead, we can create a new class `TrustedTagInspectorImpl` that implements the `TagInspector` interface, which is still present in the new library version.
* We can then override the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method to provide our own implementation.
* Note that the `TrustedTagInspector` class itself was not actually removed, but its public constructor and the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method were removed. This means that we cannot use the `TrustedTagInspector` class directly, but we can still implement its interface and provide our own implementation of its methods.
* The `import` statement for `TrustedTagInspector` has been removed, since it is no longer used.
* The `import` statement for `Tag` has been added, since it is used by the `isGlobalTagAllowed` method.
* The `isGlobalTagAllowed` method has been implemented to always return `true` as an example, but you can replace this with your own logic.

Here is a possible patch for the failing method:
```java
@Test
void shouldPullPushedByDigest() throws Exception {
    this.client.run("push", this.image.remote());
    this.client.run("image", "rm", this.image.name());
    this.client.run("image", "rm", this.image.remote());
    final String output = this.client.run("pull", this.image.remoteByDigest());
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        output,
        new StringContains(this.image.remoteByDigest())
    );
}
```
The patch removes the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, since it is not needed and is causing a compilation error. The `StringContains` matcher only needs the expected substring as an argument.

Note that this patch assumes that the `run` method of the `client` object returns a `String` object, and that the `remoteByDigest` method of the `image` object returns a `String` object. If these assumptions are incorrect, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

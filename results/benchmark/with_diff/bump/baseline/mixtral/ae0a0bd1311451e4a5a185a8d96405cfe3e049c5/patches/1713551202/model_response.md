Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionOnInvalidPath() {
    MatcherAssert.assertThat(
        Assertions.assertThrows(
            IllegalArgumentException.class,
            () -> new UploadEntity.Request(
                new RequestLine(RqMethod.PUT, "/one/two").toString()
            ).name()
        ).getMessage(),
        new StringStartsWith("Unexpected path")
    );
}
```

In this patch, I replaced the `StringContains` matcher with the `StringStartsWith` matcher, which has the same semantics but a different signature. This allows the code to compile with the new version of the library.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` decorator, because the method is still overriding a method in the new version. I also did not introduce any new variables, because they were not necessary to make the code easier to understand. I did not use any removed library methods, and I used the added `StringStartsWith` matcher.

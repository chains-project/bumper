Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    StringStartsWith startsWith = new StringStartsWith("/v2/test/blobs/uploads/");
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader("Location", startsWith),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In this patch, I have created a new variable `startsWith` that stores the `StringStartsWith` matcher with the expected prefix. This allows us to pass a single argument to the `IsHeader` constructor, which is the expected value of the "Location" header. This should fix the error you encountered, as it now matches the expected method signature.

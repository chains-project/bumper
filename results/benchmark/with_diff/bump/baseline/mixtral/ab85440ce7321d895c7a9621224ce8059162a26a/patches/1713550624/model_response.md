Here is a possible patch for the code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In the original code, the `StringContains` constructor is called with two arguments: a boolean and a string. However, the `StringContains` constructor only accepts a single string argument.

In the patched code, the boolean argument has been removed. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run.

Note that the `StringContains` class is part of the Hamcrest library, which is used for matcher-based unit testing in Java. The `assertThat` method, which is called in the original code, takes a matcher as an argument. In this case, the matcher is created using the `StringContains` constructor. The `StringContains` constructor creates a matcher that matches a string if it contains a specified substring. The patched code only specifies the substring, not the boolean value. This is because the `StringContains` constructor only accepts a single argument.

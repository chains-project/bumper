Here's a fixed version of the `isUploadStarted` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

The only change made is to assign the value `false` to a new variable `startsWith`, and then pass that variable as the first argument to the `StringStartsWith` constructor. This resolves the error message, which indicates that the constructor was expecting a single `String` argument, but was instead receiving a `boolean` and a `String`.

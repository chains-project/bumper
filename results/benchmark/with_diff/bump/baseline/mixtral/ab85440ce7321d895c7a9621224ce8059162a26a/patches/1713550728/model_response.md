Here's a possible patch for the code that should fix the error:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The change I made is to remove the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor. In the new library version, this constructor takes only one argument (a `String`), so passing `false` as a second argument causes a compile error. By removing this argument, the code should compile and run correctly.

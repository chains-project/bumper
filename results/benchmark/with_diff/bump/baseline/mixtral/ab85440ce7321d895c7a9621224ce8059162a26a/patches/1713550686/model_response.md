Here's a possible patch for the given code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The only change made is to remove the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor. The `StringContains` matcher now only takes a single argument, which is the expected substring. This change is based on the error message, which indicates that the `StringContains` constructor now requires only a single argument.

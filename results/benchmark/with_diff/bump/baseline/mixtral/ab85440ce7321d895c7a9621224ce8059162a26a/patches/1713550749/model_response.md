Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The only change I made is in the `MatcherAssert.assertThat` line, where I replaced the `new StringContains(false, "Pushed")` constructor with `new StringContains("Pushed")`. This is because the `StringContains` constructor now only takes a single argument, which is the expected substring. The `boolean` argument that was previously used to indicate whether the match should be case-sensitive has been removed.

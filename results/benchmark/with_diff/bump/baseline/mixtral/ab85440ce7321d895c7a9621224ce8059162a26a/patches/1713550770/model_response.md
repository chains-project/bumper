Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```
The only change I made is in the `assertThat` statement. In the new library version, the `StringContains` constructor no longer accepts a `boolean` parameter. Therefore, I removed the `false` parameter and kept only the string `"Pushed"`. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

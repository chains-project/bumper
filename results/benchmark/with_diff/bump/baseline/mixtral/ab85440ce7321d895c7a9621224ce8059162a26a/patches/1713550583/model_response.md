Here's the fixed version of the `largeImagePullWorks` method:

```java
@Test
void largeImagePullWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        this.client.run("image", "rm", this.remote());
        StringContains stringContains = new StringContains(String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", this.remote()));
        final String output = this.client.run("pull", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, stringContains);
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

The issue was caused by the incorrect usage of the `StringContains` constructor. I replaced the incorrect usage with a proper constructor call. The `StringContains` constructor should only take a single argument, which is the expected substring. In the original code, an additional boolean argument was provided, causing the compilation error.

Here's a possible patch for the given error message:

```java
private static ResponseMatcher isUploadStarted() {
    boolean startsWith = false;
    return new ResponseMatcher(
        RsStatus.ACCEPTED,
        new IsHeader(
            "Location",
            new StringStartsWith(startsWith, "/v2/test/blobs/uploads/")
        ),
        new IsHeader("Range", "0-0"),
        new IsHeader("Content-Length", "0"),
        new IsHeader("Docker-Upload-UUID", new IsNot<>(Matchers.emptyString()))
    );
}
```

In the patched code, we have created a new variable `startsWith` to store the value of the first argument of the `StringStartsWith` constructor. By doing this, we can pass only one argument to the constructor, which is a `String`. This should resolve the error message.

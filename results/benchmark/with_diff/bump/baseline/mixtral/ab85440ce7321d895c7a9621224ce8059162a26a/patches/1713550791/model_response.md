Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```

In this patch, I changed the argument of the `StringContains` constructor from `new StringContains(false, "Pushed")` to `new StringContains("Pushed")`. This is because the `StringContains` constructor now only accepts a single argument, which is the expected substring, instead of two arguments, which were the negated flag and the expected substring. The negated flag was removed in the new library version.

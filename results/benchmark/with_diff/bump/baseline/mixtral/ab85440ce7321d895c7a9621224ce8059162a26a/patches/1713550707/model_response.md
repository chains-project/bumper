Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Test
void largeImageUploadWorks() throws Exception {
    try {
        this.buildImage();
        final String output = this.client.run("push", this.remote());
        MatcherAssert.assertThat(output, new StringContains("Pushed"));
    } finally {
        this.client.run("rmi", this.remote());
    }
}
```
In this patch, I have changed the argument passed to the `StringContains` constructor from `new StringContains(false, "Pushed")` to `new StringContains("Pushed")`. This is because the `StringContains` constructor now only accepts a single argument, which is the expected substring. The second argument, which was used to specify whether the substring should be matched as a regular expression, has been removed in the new library version.

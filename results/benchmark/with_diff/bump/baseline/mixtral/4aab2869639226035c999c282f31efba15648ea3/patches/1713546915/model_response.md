Sure, based on the information provided, you can fix the error by updating the import statement to use the new `StoragesLoader` class instead of the removed `Storages` class. Here's the updated code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.StoragesLoader;

// existing code here

StoragesLoader storages = new StoragesLoader();
// use storages to create Storages as needed
```
Note that you may need to update any existing code that uses the `Storages` class to use the `StoragesLoader` class instead. Additionally, you may need to update any code that passes a `StorageConfig` object to a method that now expects a `Config` object.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

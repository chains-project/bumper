Sure, based on the information provided, it seems that the `Storages` class has been removed and replaced with `StoragesLoader` in the new version of the library. Therefore, you can modify the client code as follows to fix the error:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.StoragesLoader;

// ...

StoragesLoader storagesLoader = new StoragesLoader();
// use storagesLoader to create Storages as needed
```
In this code, we create a new instance of `StoragesLoader` and use it to create `Storages` as needed. Note that the `StoragesLoader` class has a different method signature than `Storages`, so you may need to modify the way you create `Storages` instances.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Sure, I understand the requirements. Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.StorageFactory;
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Config;
import com.artipie.asto.Storage;
import java.util.Map;

// ...

Storage storage = StorageFactory.newStorage(Config.fromYaml(yamlMapping));
```
Explanation:

* I replaced the import statement for `Storages` with an import statement for `StorageFactory`.
* I created a new variable `storage` to hold the created `Storage` object.
* I used the new method `StorageFactory.newStorage(Config)` to create a new `Storage` object.
* I used the `Config.fromYaml(yamlMapping)` method to create a new `Config` object from a `YamlMapping` object.

Note that the `StorageFactory` class now has a different method signature for creating a new `Storage` object. Instead of taking a `StorageConfig` object, it now takes a `Config` object. Therefore, we need to convert the `YamlMapping` object to a `Config` object using the `Config.fromYaml(yamlMapping)` method.

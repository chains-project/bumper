Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
private Matcher<String> layersAlreadyExist() {
    String prefix = "%s: Layer already exists";
    return new StringContains(String.format(prefix, this.image.layer()));
}
```

This patch removes the `false` argument from the `StringContains` constructor, which was causing the error. Instead, it defines a `prefix` variable to store the common part of the expected error message, and uses it in the `String.format` method. This way, the `StringContains` constructor only receives a single argument, which is the expected error message.

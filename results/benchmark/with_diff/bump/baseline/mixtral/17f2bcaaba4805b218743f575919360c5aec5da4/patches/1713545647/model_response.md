Here is a possible patch for the failing code:

```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```

This patch imports the new classes that were added in the updated library version and defines a `size` method that creates instances of these classes and calls their `size` method. The result of these calls is summed up and returned as the result of the `size` method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `size` method is not overriding any method in the new version. If it is, the `@Override` decorator should be added back.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
    ignore("some message");
    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we're importing the `ignore` method from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` instead of using the `@Ignore` annotation from `org.junit`. This allows us to continue using the `ignore` functionality without relying on the outdated `Ignore` class from the previous version of the library.

Note that the `ignore` method takes a message as a parameter, so you may need to modify the code inside the `testSomething` method to include a message if it was not already present in the original code.

Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```
This patch imports the new classes that were added in the updated library version and uses their `size()` method to calculate the size.

Note that this is just one possible solution and there might be other ways to fix the error.

Also, note that this patch assumes that the original `size()` method was not overriding any method in the old version of the library. If it was, you might need to adjust the patch accordingly.

Finally, note that this patch might not be the most efficient solution, as it creates new instances of the imported classes just to calculate their size. If performance is a concern, you might want to consider other approaches, such as caching the size values or using a different design.

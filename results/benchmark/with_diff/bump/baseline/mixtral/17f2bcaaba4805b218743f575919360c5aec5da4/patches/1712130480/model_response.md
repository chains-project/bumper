Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
    ignore("some message");
    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we're importing the `ignore` method from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` instead of using the `@Ignore` annotation from `org.junit`. This allows us to continue using the `ignore` functionality while avoiding the error caused by the missing `Ignore` symbol.

Note that we're using the static import statement to import the `ignore` method. This is because the `ignore` method is a static method in the `Assertions` class.

Also note that we're calling the `ignore` method with a message argument. This is because the `ignore` method takes a message argument, which is used to provide a reason for ignoring the test. In this case, we're using the string "some message" as a placeholder for the actual reason. You can replace this with an appropriate message that describes why the test is being ignored.

Finally, note that we're not changing the method signature or removing the `@Test` annotation. This is because the method is still a test method that needs to be executed by JUnit. We're only changing the implementation of the method to use the `ignore` method instead of the `@Ignore` annotation.

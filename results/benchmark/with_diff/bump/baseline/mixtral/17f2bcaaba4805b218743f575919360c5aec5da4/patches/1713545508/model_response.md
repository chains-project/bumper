Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
    int size = 0;
    size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
    size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
    size += new MinHeap().size();
    size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
    return size;
}
```
Explanation:

* I imported the new classes that were added in the updated library version.
* I created a new method `size()` that returns the sum of the sizes of the new classes that were added in the updated library version.
* I created instances of the new classes using their default constructors.
* I called the `size()` method on each instance and added the result to a `size` variable.
* I returned the `size` variable at the end of the method.

Note:

* This patch assumes that the `size()` method is not overriding any method in the new version.
* This patch is just one possible solution, and there might be other ways to fix the error.
* This patch might not be the most efficient or elegant solution, but it should work.
* This patch might not be suitable for all use cases, and it might need to be adapted or modified depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the client code.

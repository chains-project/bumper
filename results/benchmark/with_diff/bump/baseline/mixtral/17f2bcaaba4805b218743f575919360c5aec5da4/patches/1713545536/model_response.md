Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.tinspin.index.PointIndexMMWrapper;
import org.tinspin.index.phtree.PHTreeMMP;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinHeap;
import org.tinspin.index.util.MinMaxHeap;

// ...

int size() {
  int size = 0;
  size += new PointIndexMMWrapper().size();
  size += new PHTreeMMP().size();
  size += new MinHeap().size();
  size += new MinMaxHeap().size();
  return size;
}
```
This patch imports the new classes that have a `size()` method and calls them inside the `size()` method of the client code. This way, the client code no longer depends on the `SegmentString` class and the error message should no longer appear.

Note that the patch assumes that the `size()` method of the client code was originally intended to return the sum of the sizes of some objects. If this is not the case, the patch may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.ignore;

// ...

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // ...
    ignore("some message");
    // ...
}
```
In this patch, we're importing the `ignore` method from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` instead of using the `@Ignore` annotation from `org.junit`. This allows us to continue using the `ignore` functionality without relying on the outdated `@Ignore` annotation.

Note that we're using the `ignore` method as a static method, so we don't need to create an instance of any class to use it. We simply call it with the appropriate arguments to ignore the test case or test method.

Also note that we're using JUnit 5's `Assertions` class instead of JUnit 4's `Assert` class. This is because the `@Ignore` annotation has been deprecated in JUnit 5 and replaced with the `@Disabled` annotation. However, since we cannot change the function signature or use removed library methods, we cannot use the `@Disabled` annotation here. Therefore, we use the `ignore` method instead.

Here is a possible patch for the code you provided:

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepository = GlobalComponentProvider.getGlobalRepository();
    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .setEnabledLanguages(languageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode())
            .build();
}
```

This patch creates a new variable `languageSupportRepository` to hold an instance of `LanguageSupportRepository`, which is used to get the set of enabled languages in connected mode. This set is then passed to the `setEnabledLanguages` method of the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder`.

Note that the `getEnabledLanguages` method has been removed in the new version, so it cannot be used. Instead, we use the `LanguageSupportRepository` class, which has two new methods for getting the enabled languages in connected and standalone mode. In this case, we use the method for connected mode, as it seems to be the closest match to the original functionality.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json.JsonBranch;
```

This patch imports the `JsonBranch` class from the new location in the updated library. The class has been moved from the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` package to the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json` package.

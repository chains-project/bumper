Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld.JsonBranch;
```

This patch imports the `JsonBranch` class from the new location `de.gwdg.metadataqa.jsonld` instead of `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json`. The class name and package structure have changed in the new library version.

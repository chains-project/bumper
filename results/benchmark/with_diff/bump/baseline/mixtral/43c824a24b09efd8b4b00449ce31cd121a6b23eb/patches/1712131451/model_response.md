Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.branch.Branch;

//...

Branch jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the symbol `JsonBranch` cannot be found in the package `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json`. This suggests that the class `JsonBranch` has been removed from that package in the new library version.

To fix the error, we need to find an alternative way to access the functionality provided by `JsonBranch`. After examining the library changes, we can see that the class `JsonBranch` has been moved to the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.branch` package and its name has been changed to `Branch`.

To make the code compatible with the new library version, we can import the `Branch` class from the new package and create an instance of it using the `new` keyword. We can then use this instance to access the functionality provided by `JsonBranch` in the new library version.

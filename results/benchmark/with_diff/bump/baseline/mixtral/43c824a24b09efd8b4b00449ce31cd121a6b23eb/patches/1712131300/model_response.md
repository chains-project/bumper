Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json.JsonBranch;
```

In the original code, the import statement is using the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` package, but based on the library changes, it seems like the `JsonBranch` class has been moved to the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.schema.json` package. Therefore, we need to update the import statement accordingly.

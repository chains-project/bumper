Here is a fixed version of the failing client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

// ...

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public Ssh ssh() {
  return new SshByPassword(...);
}
```
Note that I replaced the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` with `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh`, since it seems that the `Tv` annotation is now directly included in the `com.jcabi.ssh` package. I also added the `@Tv` annotation to the `ssh()` method, since it was previously applied to the method but is now applied to the class. Finally, I changed the method return type to `Ssh`, since it seems that `SshByPassword` is no longer a direct subtype of `Ssh`.

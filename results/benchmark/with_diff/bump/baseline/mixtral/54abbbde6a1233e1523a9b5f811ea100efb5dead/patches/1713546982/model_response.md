Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword implements Ssh {
    // existing code...
}
```
In this patch, I've imported `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. The `@Tv` annotation has been left in place, but it's not actually used in the code. Since the error message indicates that the `Tv` class cannot be found in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package, it seems likely that this annotation is no longer necessary.

The `Ssh` interface is still present in the new library version, so the `SshByPassword` class can still implement it. The rest of the class code remains unchanged.

Here's a fixed version of the code that removes the dependency on the `Tv` class, which has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

// ...

protected Ssh ssh(String host, String user, String password) {
    return Ssh.create(host, user, password);
}
```

Note that I replaced the usage of `SshByPassword` with a direct creation of `Ssh` object using the `create` method. This method takes the same parameters as the `SshByPassword` constructor and has the same functionality.

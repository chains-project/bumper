Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public SshByPassword connectToServer() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```
In this patch, I have imported the `SshByPassword` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package, since the `Tv` class is no longer present in the `com.jcabi.aspects` package. I have also removed the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`.

Note that I have assumed that the `connectToServer` method is not overriding any method in the new version, and that it can be annotated with `@Tv` as before. If this is not the case, please let me know and I will provide an updated patch.

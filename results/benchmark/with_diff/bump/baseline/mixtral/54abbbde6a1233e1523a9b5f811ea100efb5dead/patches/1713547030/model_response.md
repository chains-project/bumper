Here's a possible patch for the code:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword {
    // ...
}
```

In this patch, we import `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` instead of `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`. We also added the `@Tv` annotation to the `SshByPassword` class, which should fix the error.

Note that `Tv` is not a class but an annotation, so it doesn't have a package and cannot be imported. The `@Tv` annotation is used to specify the allowed versions of the `jcabi-ssh` library.

It's important to check the documentation of the library to make sure the annotation is being used correctly.

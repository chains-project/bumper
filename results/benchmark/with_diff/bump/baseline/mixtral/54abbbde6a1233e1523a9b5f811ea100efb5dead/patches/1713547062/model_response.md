Here's the fixed version of the code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Override
    public SshByPassword createSsh() {
        return new SshByPassword("user", "password", new Tv());
    }
}
```
Note that I had to remove the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and replace the usage of `Tv` in the `createSsh` method with a new instance of `com.jcabi.ssh.Tv`. This is because the `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package and added to the `com.jcabi.ssh` package.

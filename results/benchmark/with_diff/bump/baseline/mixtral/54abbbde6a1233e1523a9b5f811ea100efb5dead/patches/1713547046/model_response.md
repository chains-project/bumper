Here's a possible patch for the client code to fix the error:

```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

public class MyClass {
    @Tv
    public SshByPassword createSshConnection() {
        // your implementation here
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've imported the `SshByPassword` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package, since the `Tv` aspect is no longer available in the updated library version. This should resolve the "cannot find symbol" error for the `Tv` class. Note that this patch assumes that the `createSshConnection` method is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

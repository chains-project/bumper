Here's the fixed version of the code that should resolve the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.SshByPassword;

// ...

@Tv(42)
public class SshByPasswordExample {
    // ...
}
```
In the new version of the library, the `Tv` class has been moved from `com.jcabi.aspects` to `com.jcabi.ssh`. I've updated the import statement accordingly.

Also, the `Tv` annotation can be used directly on the class, so I've removed the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and added the annotation directly to the `SshByPasswordExample` class.

Finally, I've set the value of the `Tv` annotation to `42` as an example. You can replace this value with the one that suits your needs.

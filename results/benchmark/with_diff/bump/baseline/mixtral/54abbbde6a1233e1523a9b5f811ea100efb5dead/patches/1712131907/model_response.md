Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

// create a variable for the Tv aspect
Tv tv = new Tv();

public class SshByPassword extends SshByKey {
    // use the Tv aspect on the 'super' constructor
    public SshByPassword(String host, int port, String username, String password) {
        super(host, port, username, tv.increase(password));
    }

    // override the 'execute' method
    @Override
    public String execute(String command) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        // use the Tv aspect on the 'super' execute method
        return super.execute(tv.increase(command));
    }
}
```
In this patch, we import the `com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh` class directly instead of the `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` class, which is no longer available. We then create a variable `tv` of type `Tv` and use it in the `SshByPassword` constructor and the `execute` method to replace the removed `increase` method.

Note that we cannot remove the `@Override` decorator from the `execute` method since it is still overriding the `execute` method in the superclass.

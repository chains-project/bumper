Here's the proposed patch for the client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.ssh.Ssh;

@Tv({1, 2, 3})
public class SshByPassword {
    // existing code...
}
```
This patch imports the `Ssh` class directly from the `com.jcabi.ssh` package instead of importing the `Tv` class from `com.jcabi.aspects`. The `@Tv` annotation is still used, but it's now imported implicitly from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package.

Note that the `SshByPassword` class still has the same function signature as before, and the `@Tv` annotation is still present with the same arguments. The `Override` decorator has been removed from the class declaration since it's not overriding any method in the new version.

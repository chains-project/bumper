Here's a proposed patch for the `registerHard` method that should fix the error:
```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<ManagedObjectInstance>> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, (ManagedObject<ManagedObjectInstance>) group);
        registry.set(server, reg);
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | ClassCastException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```
The changes I made are:

* I added a `ClassCastException` to the `catch` block, since the error message suggests that there is a type mismatch between the `ManagedObject` instances in the registry and the `MOGroup` instance being added.
* I added a cast to `(ManagedObject<ManagedObjectInstance>)` when adding the `MOGroup` instance to the registry. This is necessary because the `ManagedObject` type in the registry has a type parameter, but the `MOGroup` instance does not.
* I changed the type of the `reg` variable to `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject<ManagedObjectInstance>>`. This is necessary because the `ManagedObject` instances in the registry have a type parameter, but the original code was using a raw `SortedMap` type.

Note that these changes are based on the assumption that the `MOGroup` instance being added to the registry can be cast to `ManagedObject<ManagedObjectInstance>`. If this is not the case, then further modifications may be necessary.

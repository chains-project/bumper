Here's a fixed version of the failing method that should resolve the compilation error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

...

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
  try {
    ...
  } catch (final Exception e) {
    if (e instanceof ResolverException) {
      throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to resolve dependencies.", e);
    }
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Unexpected error: " + e.getMessage(), e);
  }
}
```

In this version, I replaced the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` import with `ResolverException`, which is the new name of the class in the updated library version. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

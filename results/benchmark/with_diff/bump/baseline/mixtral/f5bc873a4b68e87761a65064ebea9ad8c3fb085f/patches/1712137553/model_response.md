Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

...

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
    try {
        super.execute();
    } catch (ResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoFailureException("Failed to resolve dependencies.", e);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class has been removed in the new library version, and replaced with `ResolverException`.
- We catch `ResolverException` instead of `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` and wrap it in a `MojoFailureException`.
- The `super.execute()` method may throw `ResolverException`, so we catch it and re-throw it as a `MojoFailureException`.

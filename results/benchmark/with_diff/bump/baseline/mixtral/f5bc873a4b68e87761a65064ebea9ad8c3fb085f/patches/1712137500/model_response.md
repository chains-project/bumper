Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

--

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    try {
        super.execute();
    } catch (ResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to resolve dependencies.", e);
    }
}
```

In the new version of the library, the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been removed and replaced with `ResolverException`. Therefore, we need to catch `ResolverException` instead of `DependencyResolutionRequiredException`.

Note that I kept the `@Override` decorator, even though it's not strictly necessary. This is because it can help catch errors if the method signature changes in the future.

Here's the fixed `unpackTheme` method with the required import statement:

```java
import org.eclipse.aether.resolution.ArtifactResolutionException;

@Override
public void unpackTheme(Theme theme, File targetDirectory) throws MojoExecutionException {
    try {
        // ... (existing code)

        // ... (existing code)

    } catch (ArtifactResolutionException e) {
        // ... (existing code)
    }
}
```

The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been replaced with `ArtifactResolutionException` from the new library version. Also, I have removed the unused import statement for `DependencyResolutionRequiredException`.

Here's the fixed `unpackTheme` method with the required import statement. I've replaced the problematic import statement with the correct one.

```java
import org.eclipse.aether.collection.DependencyResolutionException;

@Override
public void unpackTheme(Theme theme, File outputDirectory) throws MojoExecutionException {
    // ...
}
```

The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` has been replaced with `DependencyResolutionException` from the `org.eclipse.aether.collection` package.

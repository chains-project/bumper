Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ResolverException;

...

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
    try {
        super.execute();
    } catch (ResolverException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to resolve dependencies.", e);
    }
}
```

In this patch, we replace the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` with its superclass `ResolverException`, which is still present in the new library version. We then catch this exception and rethrow it as a `MojoExecutionException`, which is the expected exception type for this method.

Here's the fixed version of the method that should resolve the issue:

```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.ArtifactResolutionException;

...

@Override
public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
    try {
        ...
    } catch (ArtifactResolutionException e) {
        throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to unpack theme", e);
    }
}
```

The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class has been removed in the new version and replaced with `ArtifactResolutionException`. Therefore, we need to update the exception type in the catch block.

Sure, here's a potential patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEStringEncryptor;

import java.lang.Object;

// ...

@Override
public PBEPasswordEncoder createPasswordEncoder() {
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    PBEStringEncryptor pbeStringEncryptor = new PBEStringEncryptor();

    // configure the encryptors as needed

    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(
        textEncryptor,
        passwordEncryptor,
        pbeStringEncryptor
    );
}

@Override
public boolean isPasswordValid(String encryptedPassword, String plainPassword, Object salt) {
    return new PBEPasswordEncoder(
        new TextEncryptor(),
        new PasswordEncryptor(),
        new PBEStringEncryptor()
    ).isPasswordValid(encryptedPassword, plainPassword, salt);
}
```
Explanation:

Since the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been removed in the new library version, we need to replace its usage with the new classes provided by the library.

In this patch, we create instances of `TextEncryptor`, `PasswordEncryptor`, and `PBEStringEncryptor`, and then use them to create a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance.

Note that we can no longer use the no-argument constructor for `PBEPasswordEncoder`, since it has been removed in the new version. Instead, we need to pass in instances of the three encryptor classes.

We also create a new `PBEPasswordEncoder` instance in the `isPasswordValid` method, since we can no longer rely on the instance created by the `createPasswordEncoder` method.

Note that we don't need to change the method signatures, since the new library version still provides a `PBEPasswordEncoder` class that has the same methods as before. However, we do need to change the implementation of these methods to use the new encryptor classes.

Here is a fixed version of the code that should work with the updated library:

```java
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new PasswordEncoder() {
        private final TextEncryptor textEncryptor;
        private final PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor;

        public PasswordEncoder(TextEncryptor textEncryptor, PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor) {
            this.textEncryptor = textEncryptor;
            this.passwordEncryptor = passwordEncryptor;
        }

        @Override
        public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
            return passwordEncryptor.encryptPassword(rawPassword.toString());
        }

        @Override
        public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
            return passwordEncryptor.checkPassword(rawPassword.toString(), encodedPassword);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean upgradeEncoding(String encodedPassword) {
            // you can implement this method if needed
            return false;
        }
    };

    return passwordEncoder;
}
```

The only change I made is to add an implementation for the `upgradeEncoding` method, which was added in the updated library. This method is optional, so you can leave it empty or implement it as needed.

Note that I did not remove the `@Override` decorator from the `encode` and `matches` methods, because they are still overriding methods from the `PasswordEncoder` interface.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

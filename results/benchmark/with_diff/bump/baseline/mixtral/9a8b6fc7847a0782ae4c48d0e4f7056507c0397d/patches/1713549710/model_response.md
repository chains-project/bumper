Here's the fixed version of the method using the new library version:

```java
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    textEncryptor.setPassword(passwordEncryptor.getPassword());

    return new PasswordEncoder() {
        @Override
        public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
            return passwordEncoder.encodePassword(rawPassword.toString(), passwordEncryptor);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
            return passwordEncoder.isPasswordValid(encodedPassword, rawPassword.toString(), passwordEncryptor);
        }
    };
}
```

In this fixed version, I've created a new instance of `PasswordEncryptor` and `TextEncryptor` and set the password of `TextEncryptor` using `PasswordEncryptor`. Then, I've updated the `encode` and `matches` methods to use the new methods from the updated library version.

Please note that I had to make some assumptions about the behavior of the removed methods. If these assumptions are incorrect, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Here is a possible patch for the failing code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    PasswordEncoder delegate = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();

    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    passwordEncryptor.setAlgorithm(algorithm);
    passwordEncryptor.setIterationCount(iterationCount);

    delegate.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncryptor);
    delegate.setEncodeHashAsBase64(true);

    return delegate;
}
```
Here are some explanations for the changes made:

* I removed the import for `org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder` because it is no longer available in the new library version.
* I added imports for `org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor`, `org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor`, `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder`, and `org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` to use their equivalent classes and methods.
* I replaced the use of `PBEPasswordEncoder` with `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder`, which is a similar class that provides password encoding using the PKCS5WithHmacSHA1/PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 algorithm.
* I created instances of `TextEncryptor`, `PasswordEncryptor`, and `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` to replace the functionality of the removed methods.
* I set the necessary properties for each instance, such as the password, algorithm, iteration count, etc.
* I set the `PasswordEncoder` delegate to use the `PasswordEncryptor` instance for encoding the passwords.
* I set the `encodeHashAsBase64` property of the `PasswordEncoder` delegate to `true` to match the behavior of the removed `encodePassword` method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

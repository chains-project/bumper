Here's the proposed patch:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

@Override
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new TextEncryptor();
    PasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new PasswordEncryptor();
    PasswordEncoder delegate = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();

    textEncryptor.setPassword(password);
    passwordEncryptor.setAlgorithm(algorithm);
    delegate.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncryptor);

    return new PasswordEncoder() {
        @Override
        public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
            return delegate.encode(rawPassword);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
            return delegate.matches(rawPassword, encodedPassword);
        }
    };
}
```
Explanation:
The `PBEPasswordEncoder` class has been removed from the library, so we need to find an alternative way to encode and validate passwords.
The `TextEncryptor` and `PasswordEncryptor` classes can be used to encrypt and hash passwords respectively.
The `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` class from the Spring framework can be used as a delegate to handle encoding and validation.
We create instances of `TextEncryptor`, `PasswordEncryptor`, and `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder`, set their properties, and return a new `PasswordEncoder` instance that delegates to the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` instance.
Note: The `password` and `algorithm` variables are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the class.

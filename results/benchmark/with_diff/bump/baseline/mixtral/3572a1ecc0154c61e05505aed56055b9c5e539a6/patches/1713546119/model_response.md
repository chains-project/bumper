Here is a possible patch for the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;

// ...

TFastFramedTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), System.in, System.out));
```
This patch creates a `TIOStreamTransport` object using the `TConfiguration`, `InputStream`, and `OutputStream` parameters, and then uses it to create a `TFastFramedTransport` object. This should fix the "cannot find symbol" error for `TFastFramedTransport`.

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the desired behavior of the code, since the original code was not provided. You may need to adjust the parameters to `TIOStreamTransport` or the way it is used to create `TFastFramedTransport` to match your specific needs.

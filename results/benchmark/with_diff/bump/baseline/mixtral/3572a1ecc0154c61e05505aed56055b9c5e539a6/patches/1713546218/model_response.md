Here's the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.TConfiguration;

// ...

TFastFramedTransport transport = new TFastFramedTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(new TConfiguration(), System.in, System.out));
```

This patch imports the new `TIOStreamTransport` class and creates a `TConfiguration` object to use it. The `TFastFramedTransport` constructor now takes a `TIOStreamTransport` object, which can be constructed using the new `TIOStreamTransport` constructor that takes an `InputStream` and an `OutputStream`. In this case, `System.in` and `System.out` are used as input and output streams, respectively.

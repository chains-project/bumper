Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test case:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` that overrides the `matches` method. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and checks if it contains the expected string. The `StringContains` constructor takes a `boolean` and a `String` argument, which is why the error message complains about the wrong types. By creating a new subclass and overriding the `matches` method, we can fix the error and make the code work with the new library version.

The `StringContains` class is from the Hamcrest library, which is not modified in the new version, so we can still use it. The `Override` decorator is not needed, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
The patch only modifies the failing method, and it does not use any removed library methods or symbols. It only uses the `StringContains` class, which is still available in the new version.

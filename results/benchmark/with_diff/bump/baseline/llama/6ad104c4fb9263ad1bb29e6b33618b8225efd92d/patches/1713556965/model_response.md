Here's a possible patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TlsFatalAlert alert = new TlsFatalAlert(0);
        AlertDescription description = alert.getAlertDescription();
        System.out.println(description.getMessage());
    }
}
```
We imported the `TlsFatalAlert` class from the `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` package, which is the same package that contains the `AlertDescription` class. Then, we created a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance and called its `getAlertDescription()` method to get an `AlertDescription` object. Finally, we printed the message of the `AlertDescription` object to the console.

Note that we did not need to remove or modify any methods, as the `TlsFatalAlert` class and its `getAlertDescription()` method are still present in the updated version of the library.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    public static TlsFatalAlert getTlsFatalAlert(short alertDescription) {
        return new TlsFatalAlert(alertDescription);
    }
}
```

The patch removes the import statement for `AlertDescription` and instead imports `TlsFatalAlert` from the same package. It also removes the method `getAlertDescription()` and creates a new method `getTlsFatalAlert()` that returns a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance with the given `alertDescription`.


The patch also removes the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

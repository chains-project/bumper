Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public TlsFatalAlert getAlertDescription() {
    return TlsFatalAlert.getInstance(getAlertDescription().getMessage());
}
```
This patch removes the call to `getAlertDescription()` on the `TlsFatalAlert` class, as it is no longer available in the updated version of the library. Instead, it creates a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance using the `getMessage()` method of the `AlertDescription` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `AlertDescription` class is still available in the updated version of the library. If it's not, a different approach might be needed.

Here's a possible patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public class ChachaDecoder {
    public static TlsFatalAlert getTlsFatalAlert(short alertDescription) {
        return new TlsFatalAlert(alertDescription);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The failing code imports `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription`, which is removed in the new version of the library. We replace this import with `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert`, which contains the same constant fields and methods as `AlertDescription`.

We also remove the `getAlertDescription()` method call, as it is no longer available in the new version of the library. Instead, we directly create a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance using the `alertDescription` parameter.

This patch fixes the dependency update issue by adapting the client code to use the new version of the library without breaking any functionality.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.TlsFatalAlert;

public TlsFatalAlert getTlsFatalAlert() {
    return new TlsFatalAlert(AlertDescription.create("", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0));
}
```
This patch creates a new `TlsFatalAlert` instance using the `AlertDescription` constructor that takes eight arguments. This is a compatible alternative to the removed `TlsFatalAlert(short)` constructor.

Additionally, the `getAlertDescription()` method has been removed, as it is no longer available in the updated library version. Instead, we're using the `AlertDescription.create()` method to create a new `AlertDescription` instance with the desired values.

```
private void prepareTextfieldWithBorder(final JRDesignTextElement textField, final ColumnStyle style)
{
    final ColumnBorder border = style.getColBorder();
    if(border == null)
    {
        return;
    }
    float lineWidth = border.getLineWidth();
    textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineWidth(lineWidth);
    textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineColor(border.getLineColor());
    textField.getLineBox().getPen().setLineStyle(border.getLineStyle().getLineStyleEnum());
}
```
The error was caused by the fact that the `setLineWidth()` method in the `JRPen` class was removed in the new library version, and the `setLineWidth(float)` method in the `JRBasePen` class was removed as well.

In the proposed patch, we create a local variable `lineWidth` to hold the value of `border.getLineWidth()`, which is a `float`, and then pass this variable to the `setLineWidth()` method. This fixes the incompatible types error.

It's worth noting that the `JRBasePen` class has been marked as deprecated in the new library version, so it's recommended to use the `JRPen` class instead, and to remove the `Override` decorator if the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and returns `true` if the string contains the expected message, and `false` otherwise.

The `StringContains` constructor that takes a `boolean` and a `String` argument is used to create a `Matcher` that matches strings that contain the expected message. The `Override` decorator is not needed as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

The patch does not use any removed library methods identified with `--`, but it uses the added library method `StringContains` identified with `++`.

The returned code segment replaces the entire failing client code.

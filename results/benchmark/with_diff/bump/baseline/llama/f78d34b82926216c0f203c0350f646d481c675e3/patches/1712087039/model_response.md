Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
public void input(ArrayList<Input> inputData) {
    inputData.parallelStream().forEachOrdered(input -> {
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.getWeightingValue().length; i++) {
            sum += input.getWeightingValue()[i] * sigmoid(input.getInputs().get(i).getWeightingValue());
        }
        setValue(sigmoid(sum));
    });
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the removal of the `sigmoid` method from the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class. To fix this, we can use the `sigmoid` method from the `tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath` class, which is a static method with the same signature as the removed method.

We can also remove the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

Note that we're using the `tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath` class instead of `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` to avoid conflicts with the removed methods.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
public void input(ArrayList<Input> inputData) {
    inputData.parallelStream().forEachOrdered(input -> {
        D weightingValue = tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid(input.getWeightingValue());
        setValue(weightingValue);
    });
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the absence of the `sigmoid()` method in the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath` class. The `sigmoid()` method has been moved to the `tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath` class in the new version of the library. Therefore, we need to update the import statement to use the new library and qualify the `sigmoid()` method call with the correct package name.

The proposed patch updates the `input()` method to use the `tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid()` method instead of the `develop.p2p.lib.LearnMath.sigmoid()` method. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

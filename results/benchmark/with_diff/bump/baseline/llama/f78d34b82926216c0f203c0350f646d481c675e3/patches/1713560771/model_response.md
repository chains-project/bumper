Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import tokyo.peya.lib.WaveCreator;
import tokyo.peya.lib.FileConfiguration;
import tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath;
import tokyo.peya.lib.LeetConverter;
import tokyo.peya.lib.TimeParser;

public class Decorations {
    // ...

    public static void magic(Player player, int seconds) {
        // ...

        WaveCreator wave = new WaveCreator(0.8, 1.8, 0.1);
        // ...
    }
}
```
We imported the necessary classes from the `tokyo.peya.lib` package, which contains the `WaveCreator` class and other utility classes that were removed in the updated library version. We then create a new instance of `WaveCreator` with the same parameters as before.


Note that we didn't need to modify any other part of the code, as the changes in the updated library version did not affect the rest of the code.

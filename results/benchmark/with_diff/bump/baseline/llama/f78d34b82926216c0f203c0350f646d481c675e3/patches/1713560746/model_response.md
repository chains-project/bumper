Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import tokyo.peya.lib.WaveCreator;

public class Decorations {
    public static WaveCreator getWaveCreator(double frequency, double amplitude, double speed) {
        return new WaveCreator(frequency, amplitude, speed);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `develop.p2p.lib` package has been removed and replaced with the `tokyo.peya.lib` package. The `WaveCreator` class is now part of the `tokyo.peya.lib` package, so we need to update the import statement and the constructor call to reflect this change.

The proposed patch imports the `WaveCreator` class from the `tokyo.peya.lib` package and creates a static method `getWaveCreator` that returns a new instance of `WaveCreator` with the given frequency, amplitude, and speed. This method can be used instead of the original constructor call to create a `WaveCreator` instance.

Note that we cannot use the `Override` annotation, as the `WaveCreator` class has not changed and does not need to be overridden. We also cannot remove the `develop.p2p.lib` package, as it is still used in other parts of the code.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import tokyo.peya.lib.WaveCreator;
import tokyo.peya.lib.LearnMath;
import tokyo.peya.lib.TimeParser;
import tokyo.peya.lib.LeetConverter;

public class Decorations {
    // ...

    public static void magic(Player player, int seconds) {
        // ...

        WaveCreator wave = new WaveCreator(0.8, 1.8, 0.1);
        // ...
    }
}
```
We imported the necessary classes from the `tokyo.peya.lib` package, which contains the updated versions of the removed methods, and imported them in the `Decorations` class.
We then create a new `WaveCreator` instance using the constructor that takes three double arguments, which is available in the updated version of the library.

By doing this, we're ensuring that the code uses the updated versions of the methods and classes, and the error should be resolved.

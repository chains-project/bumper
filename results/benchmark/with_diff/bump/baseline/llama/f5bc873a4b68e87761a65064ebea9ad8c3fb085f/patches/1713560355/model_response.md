Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    // ...
}
```
Replace the failing code with the above patch. The patch imports the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class and catches any exceptions that may be thrown. This should resolve the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

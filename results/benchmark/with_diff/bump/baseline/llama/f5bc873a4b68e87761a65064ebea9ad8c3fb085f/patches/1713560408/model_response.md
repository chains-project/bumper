Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

// ...

public class UnPackThemeMojo extends AbstractMojo {
  // ...

  public void execute() throws DependencyResolutionRequiredException {
    // ...
  }
}
```
The proposed patch removes the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` import statement, as it is no longer available in the updated library version. Instead, we import the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class from the `org.apache.maven.artifact` package.

Additionally, we've removed the `Override` annotation from the `execute()` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed without affecting the method's functionality.


This patch should fix the compilation error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    // ...
}
```
Replace the failing code with the above code. The `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class has been removed in the new version of the library, so we need to remove the import statement and any references to the class. Instead, we can use a `try`-`catch` block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown.

Note that this patch assumes that the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that the removal of the import statement and references to the class do not cause any issues. If this is not the case, a more comprehensive approach may be needed to address the issue.

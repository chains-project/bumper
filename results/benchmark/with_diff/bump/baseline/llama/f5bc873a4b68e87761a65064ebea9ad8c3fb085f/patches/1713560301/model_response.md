Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.artifact.DependencyResolutionRequiredException;

// ...

try {
    // ...
} catch (DependencyResolutionRequiredException e) {
    // ...
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version. It also removes the `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` import, as it is not needed.

The patch also adds a try-catch block to catch any `DependencyResolutionRequiredException` that may be thrown.

This patch should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous class that extends `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and checks if it contains the expected string.

The `StringContains` constructor that takes a boolean and a `String` argument is used to create a `Matcher` that matches strings containing the expected string.

The `Override` decorator is used to indicate that the `matches` method is overriding the one from the superclass.

The patch uses the `String.format` method to create a message that includes the `image` parameter, and the `contains` method to check if the resulting string contains the expected string.

The patch does not use any removed library methods identified with `--`, but it does use the `StringContains` class and the `Override` decorator, which are both available in the new library version.

The patch is a single method replacement, it replaces the failing `imagePulled` method with a new implementation that fixes the error.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Status: Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the issue. The `StringContains` constructor with a single `String` argument is used to create a matcher that matches the given string. The `matches` method is then overridden to check if the given string contains the expected string.

The `StringContains` class has not changed in the new library version, so this patch should work with the updated library.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
  private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
        return new StringContains(
            false,
            String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
        ) {
            @Override
            public boolean matches(String s) {
                return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
            }

            @Override
            public void describeTo(Description description) {
                description.appendText("Image pulled: ");
                description.appendValue(image);
            }
        };
    }
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` that overrides the `matches` and `describeTo` methods. The `matches` method checks if the input string contains the expected message, and the `describeTo` method appends the message to the description.

The `StringContains` constructor that takes a boolean and a string is used to create a matcher that matches the expected message. The `false` argument ensures that the matcher will not match any string that contains the given message.

The `Override` decorator is not needed, as the `matches` and `describeTo` methods are not overriding any methods in the new version of the library.

The patch does not use any removed library methods identified with `--`, and it uses the added library method `StringContains` identified with `++`.

The patch returns a `Matcher` object that can be used to check if a given string matches the expected message.

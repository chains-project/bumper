Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;

public class SCoverageReportMojo {
    private RenderingContext renderingContext;

    public SCoverageReportMojo() {
        renderingContext = new org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.DoxiaDocumentRenderer(new org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext()).getRenderingContext();
    }

    public void execute() {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new `DoxiaDocumentRenderer` instance and uses its `getRenderingContext()` method to obtain a `RenderingContext` instance, which is then assigned to the `renderingContext` field. This allows the client code to use the `renderingContext` instance without any changes.


Note that the `DoxiaDocumentRenderer` class has been added to the `org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer` package in the new library version, which is why we need to use it instead of the removed `org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext` class.

Also, the `getOutputName()` method has been added to the `RenderingContext` interface in the new library version, which is why we can use it to get the output name.

This patch should fix the failure and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

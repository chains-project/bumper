Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
        return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                .addEnabledLanguages(globalConfig.getEnabledLanguages())
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    }
```

We can see that the error is caused by the fact that the `addEnabledLanguages` method has been removed from the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` class. To fix this, we can use the `LanguageSupportRepository` class to get the enabled languages and then pass them to the `addLanguages` method. Here's the modified code:
```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
        LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepository = new LanguageSupportRepository();
        Set<String> enabledLanguages = languageSupportRepository.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode();
        return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
                .addLanguages(enabledLanguages)
                .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
                .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
                .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
                .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
                .build();
    }
```
In this modified code, we first create a `LanguageSupportRepository` instance and then use its `getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode` method to get the enabled languages. We then pass this set of languages to the `addLanguages` method of the `AnalysisEngineConfiguration.Builder` class.


Note that we had to remove the `Override` annotation, as the `addEnabledLanguages` method has been removed from the library. Also, we had to use the `getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode` method instead of `getEnabledLanguages` to get the enabled languages, as the latter has been removed as well.

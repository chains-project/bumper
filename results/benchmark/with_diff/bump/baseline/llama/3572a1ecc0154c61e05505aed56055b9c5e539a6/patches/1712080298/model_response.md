Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we need to replace all instances of `TFastFramedTransport` with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a subclass of `TTransport` and can be used as a drop-in replacement for `TFastFramedTransport`. We can create an instance of `TIOStreamTransport` using the `TConfiguration` object and an `InputStream` or `OutputStream` object, depending on the specific use case.

In the `AppenderUtils` class, we can replace the `TFastFramedTransport` constructor with a call to the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor, passing in the `TTransport` object as an argument. This will create a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance that wraps the given `TTransport` object.


Note that we're also importing the `TIOStreamTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, as it's not available in the default package.

import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
This patch fixes the error by replacing the import of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TIOStreamTransport`. The `TIOStreamTransport` class has been added to the library in the new version, and it provides the same functionality as `TFastFramedTransport`. The `getTransport` method has been modified to return an instance of `TIOStreamTransport` instead of `TFastFramedTransport`.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TTransport` parameter passed to the `getTransport` method is an instance of `TIOStreamTransport`. If this is not the case, additional changes may be required to handle the different types of transports.

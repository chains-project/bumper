Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we need to replace all occurrences of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TIOStreamTransport`.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a new addition to the library, and it can be used as a replacement for `TFastFramedTransport`. We can create an instance of `TIOStreamTransport` using the `TConfiguration` object, and then use it to wrap the `TTransport` object.

The `getTransport` method in the `AppenderUtils` class is modified to return a `TIOStreamTransport` instance instead of a `TFastFramedTransport` instance. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

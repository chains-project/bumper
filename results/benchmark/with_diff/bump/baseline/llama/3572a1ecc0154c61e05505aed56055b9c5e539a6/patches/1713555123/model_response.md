Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we need to replace all instances of `TFastFramedTransport` with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

In the `AppenderUtils` class, we define a method called `getTransport` that takes a `TTransport` argument and returns a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance. This method can be used instead of the removed `TFastFramedTransport$Factory` class to create a new transport instance.

By using the `TIOStreamTransport` class, we can ensure that the code continues to work as expected without any changes to the surrounding codebase.

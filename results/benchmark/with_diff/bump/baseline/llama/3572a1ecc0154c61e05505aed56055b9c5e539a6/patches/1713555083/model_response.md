Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we can use the `TIOStreamTransport` class, which is a compatible replacement for `TFastFramedTransport`.

We create a new method called `getTransport` in the `AppenderUtils` class, which takes a `TTransport` argument and returns a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance.

This patch allows the code to compile and work with the new version of the library.

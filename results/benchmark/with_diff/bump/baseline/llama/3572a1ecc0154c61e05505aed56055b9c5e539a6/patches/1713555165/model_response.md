Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we need to replace all occurrences of `TFastFramedTransport` with `TIOStreamTransport`.

In the code, we're importing the `TIOStreamTransport` class from the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package, and then creating a new instance of it using the `TTransport` parameter. This will create a new transport that wraps the given transport and provides the same functionality as `TFastFramedTransport`.

We're also removing the `Override` annotation, as it's not needed in this case.

With this patch, the code should now compile without any errors related to `TFastFramedTransport`.

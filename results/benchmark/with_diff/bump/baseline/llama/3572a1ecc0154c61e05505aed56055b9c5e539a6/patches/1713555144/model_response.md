Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we can use the `TIOStreamTransport` class, which is a compatible replacement for `TFastFramedTransport`.

We create a new `TTransport` object using the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor that takes a `TTransport` argument. This allows us to use the `TTransport` object returned by `getTransport()` with the `TIOStreamTransport` class.

By doing this, we avoid using the removed `TFastFramedTransport` class and instead use the new `TIOStreamTransport` class, which is compatible with the new version of the library.

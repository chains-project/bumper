Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we need to replace all instances of `TFastFramedTransport` with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a subclass of `TTransport` and it takes a `TConfiguration` object and an `InputStream` or `OutputStream` object as parameters in its constructor. Since we don't have access to the `TConfiguration` object, we can create a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance with a `TTransport` object as a parameter.

In the `AppenderUtils` class, we define a method called `getTransport` that takes a `TTransport` object as a parameter and returns a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance. This method can be used instead of the removed `TFastFramedTransport` class.


Note that we don't need to modify the method signature, as the `TIOStreamTransport` class has the same method signature as the `TFastFramedTransport` class.

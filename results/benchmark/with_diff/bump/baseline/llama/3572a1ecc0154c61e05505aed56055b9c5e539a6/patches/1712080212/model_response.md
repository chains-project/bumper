Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the import statement for `TFastFramedTransport` with an import statement for `TIOStreamTransport`, and changes the factory method `getTransport()` to return an instance of `TIOStreamTransport` instead of `TFastFramedTransport`.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a subclass of `TTransport` and can be used as a replacement for `TFastFramedTransport` in this context. The `TIOStreamTransport` class takes an `InputStream` or `OutputStream` argument in its constructor, which can be used to create a connection to the server.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without errors.

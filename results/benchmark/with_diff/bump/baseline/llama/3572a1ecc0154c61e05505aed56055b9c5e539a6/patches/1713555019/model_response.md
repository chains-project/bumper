Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we need to replace the import statement and the creation of the `TFastFramedTransport` object with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a subclass of `TTransport` and can be used as a replacement for `TFastFramedTransport`. We create a new instance of `TIOStreamTransport` using the `TTransport` parameter, which is the same as the old `TFastFramedTransport` constructor.

With this change, the code should now compile and work as expected.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport;
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class AppenderUtils {
    public static TTransport getTransport(TTransport transport) {
        return new TIOStreamTransport(transport);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `TFastFramedTransport` class has been removed from the latest version of the Thrift library. To fix this, we need to replace all instances of `TFastFramedTransport` with the new `TIOStreamTransport` class.

The `TIOStreamTransport` class is a subclass of `TTransport` and provides similar functionality to `TFastFramedTransport`. We can use it as a drop-in replacement for `TFastFramedTransport` in the `AppenderUtils` class.

In the `getTransport` method, we create a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance using the `TTransport` parameter. This allows us to reuse the same code that was previously using `TFastFramedTransport`.

By making this change, we avoid the dependency on the removed `TFastFramedTransport` class and instead use the new `TIOStreamTransport` class, which is available in the latest version of the Thrift library.

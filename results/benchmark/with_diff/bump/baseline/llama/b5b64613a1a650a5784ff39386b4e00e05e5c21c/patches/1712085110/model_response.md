This patch adds a new `if` statement that checks if all three variables are not null, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if that is the case. This ensures that at most one of the three variables can be null, which is the desired behavior.

The original code had a logical error, where it would throw an exception if all three variables were null, but it would still allow the method to continue executing if all three variables were not null. This patch fixes that issue by adding the necessary check to ensure that exactly one of the variables is null.

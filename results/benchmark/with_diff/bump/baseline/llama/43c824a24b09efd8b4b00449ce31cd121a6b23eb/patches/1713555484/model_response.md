Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private JsonBranch jsonBranch;

    public MarcFactory() {
        this.jsonBranch = new JsonBranch();
    }

    public MarcFactory(JsonBranch jsonBranch) {
        this.jsonBranch = jsonBranch;
    }

    public void createMarcRecord() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new constructor that takes a `JsonBranch` object as a parameter, and sets the `jsonBranch` field to the passed object. This allows the client code to continue using the `JsonBranch` class, even though it has been removed from the library. The `createMarcRecord()` method remains unchanged.

Note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that the `MarcFactory` class is the only class that depends on it. If this is not the case, a more comprehensive solution may be required.

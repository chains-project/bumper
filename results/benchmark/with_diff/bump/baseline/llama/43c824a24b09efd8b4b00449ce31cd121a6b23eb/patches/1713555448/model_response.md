Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json.JsonBranch;

public class MarcFactory {
    private static final JsonBranch JSON_BRANCH = new JsonBranch();

    public static Marc createMarc() {
        JsonBranch jsonBranch = JSON_BRANCH;
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `JSON_BRANCH` of type `JsonBranch` and imports the `JsonBranch` class from the `de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.json` package. This allows the `MarcFactory` class to access the `JsonBranch` class without any issues.

The rest of the code remains unchanged.

Note: This patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class has not changed in the new library version and can still be imported and used in the same way. If the `JsonBranch` class has been modified or removed, a different patch may be necessary.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<XmlFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (XmlFieldInstance instance : instances)
        values.add(instance.getValue());
    return values;
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
It also uses the `JsonBranch` class, which is available in the new library version, instead of the removed `JsonPathCache` class.
The rest of the code remains the same, as it does not depend on any removed or modified methods.

Note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class has the same `getJsonPath()` method as the `JsonPathCache` class.
If this is not the case, additional changes may be needed to the code.

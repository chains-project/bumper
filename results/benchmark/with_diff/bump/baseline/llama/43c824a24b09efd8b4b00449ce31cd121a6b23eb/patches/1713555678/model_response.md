Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static List<String> extractList(JsonPathCache cache, JsonBranch branch) {
    List<XmlFieldInstance> instances = cache.get(branch.getJsonPath());
    List<String> values = new ArrayList<>();
    if (instances != null)
      for (XmlFieldInstance instance : instances)
        values.add(instance.getValue());
    return values;
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version.
It also uses the `JsonBranch` class, which is available in the new library version.
The rest of the code remains the same, as it does not depend on any removed methods.

Note that this patch assumes that the `JsonBranch` class is in the same package as the `MarcFactory` class, if it's not, you'll have to adjust the import statement accordingly.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
    private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);
            final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            registry.set(server, reg);
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
        }
    }
```

The proposed patch replaces the failing client code and should fix the error. The patch removes the `Override` decorator, as it is not needed, and uses the `getRegistry()` method to get the `SortedMap` of managed objects, which is the same as the `registry` field. Additionally, it removes the `MOScope` parameter from the `DefaultMOContextScope` constructor, as it is not needed.

It's important to note that this patch only fixes the failing code and doesn't address any other potential issues in the code.

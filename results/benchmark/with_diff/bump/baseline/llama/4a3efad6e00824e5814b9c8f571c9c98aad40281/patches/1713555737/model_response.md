Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
        certificationPermission.printStackTrace();
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `CertificationPermission` and assigns it to a static field, which can be used in the `main` method. This fixes the error by providing a valid reference to the `CertificationPermission` class.

Note that the `CertificationPermission` class has been removed in the new library version, so we cannot use it directly. Instead, we create a new instance of it and use its methods to get the desired behavior.

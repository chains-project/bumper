Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
        certificationPermission.setCertificationLevel(CertificationLevel.CERTIFIED_COPY);
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch involves creating a static variable `certificationPermission` of type `CertificationPermission` and initializing it with a new instance of `CertificationPermission`. This allows the code to use the `CertificationPermission` class without causing a compile-time error.

In addition, the patch removes the `Override` annotation from the `main` method, as it is not necessary and can be safely removed.

Note that this patch assumes that the `CertificationPermission` class is still available in the updated library version. If the class has been removed, a different approach would be needed to fix the error.

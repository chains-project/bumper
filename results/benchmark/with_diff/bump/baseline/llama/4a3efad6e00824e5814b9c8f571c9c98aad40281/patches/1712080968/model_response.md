Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch involves creating a new instance of `CertificationPermission` and assigning it to a static variable. This allows the code to access the `CertificationPermission` class even though it's been removed from the library.

It's important to note that this is a temporary solution to fix the build error, but it's not a long-term solution. You should consider updating the dependency to the latest version, or finding an alternative way to achieve the desired functionality.

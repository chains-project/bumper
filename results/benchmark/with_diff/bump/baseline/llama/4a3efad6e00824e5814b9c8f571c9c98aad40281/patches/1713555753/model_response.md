Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

// Keep the import statement as it is

public class Signer {
    // ...

    // Replace the failing line with the following code
    CertificationPermission permission = new CertificationPermission(null, null, null, null, null);

    // ...
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `CertificationPermission` with null arguments, which should satisfy the constructor's signature in the updated library version. This change should allow the code to compile and run without any issues.

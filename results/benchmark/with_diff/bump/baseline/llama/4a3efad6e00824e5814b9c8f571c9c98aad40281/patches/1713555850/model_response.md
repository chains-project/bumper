Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    // ...
        try {
            // ...
            CertificationPermission permission = new CertificationPermission(); // Failing line
            // ...
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // ...
        }
    // ...
}
```
Replace the failing line with the following code:
```java
            eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission permission = new eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission();
```
The proposed patch imports the `CertificationPermission` class from the `eu.europa.esig.dss.pades` package, which is the same package as the one that has been updated, and creates a new instance of the `CertificationPermission` class.

By doing this, we're ensuring that the `CertificationPermission` class is being imported from the updated library version, and not from the old one, which doesn't contain the class anymore.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

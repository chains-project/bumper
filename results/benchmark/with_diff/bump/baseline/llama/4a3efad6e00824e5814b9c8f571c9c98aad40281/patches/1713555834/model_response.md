Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public class Signer {
    private static final CertificationPermission certificationPermission = new CertificationPermission();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static variable `certificationPermission` of type `CertificationPermission`, which is the same type that was imported. This allows the code to compile without errors related to the missing `CertificationPermission` class.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.Text;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final Text joinedText;

    public WalletsIn(String... texts) {
        this.joinedText = Text.join(texts);
    }

    public String getJoinedText() {
        return joinedText.toString();
    }
}
```

The proposed patch removes the `JoinedText` class and uses the `Text.join(texts)` method to create a `Text` object that contains the joined text.
The `Text.join(texts)` method is a new method added in the updated library version, which can be used to join multiple strings into a single string.
This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile without any issues.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.SolidScalar;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final SolidScalar<String> walletId;

    public WalletsIn(String walletId) {
        this.walletId = SolidScalar.of(walletId);
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `SolidScalar` and replaces it with `org.cactoos.scalar.SolidScalar`.
Additionally, it removes the `Override` annotation from the constructor, as it is not necessary.
Finally, it adds a parameter to the constructor, `walletId`, which is used to initialize the `SolidScalar` instance.
This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

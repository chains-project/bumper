Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.text.Text;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final Text joinedText;

    public WalletsIn(String... texts) {
        this.joinedText = Text.join(texts);
    }

    public String getJoinedText() {
        return joinedText.toString();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `JoinedText` class import and uses the `Text.join(texts)` method to create a `Text` object that contains the joined text. The `Text.join(texts)` method is available in the new version of the library, and it serves the same purpose as the `JoinedText` class.

The patch also removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary in this case.

Please note that this patch is a suggestion, and it may need to be adjusted based on the context of the surrounding code.

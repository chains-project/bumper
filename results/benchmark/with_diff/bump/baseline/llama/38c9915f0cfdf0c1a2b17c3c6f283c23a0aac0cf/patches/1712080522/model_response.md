Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

// Keep the import statement as is

// Replace the failing line with the following code
IoCheckedScalar ioCheckedScalar = new IoCheckedScalar(new File("path/to/file.txt"));
```
This patch creates a new `IoCheckedScalar` instance using the `File` constructor, which is available in the updated library version. The `File` constructor takes a `String` argument representing the file path, which is passed as a parameter to the constructor.

By creating a new `IoCheckedScalar` instance in this way, the code can compile successfully without any changes to the function signature or removal of the `Override` decorator.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final IoCheckedScalar<String> walletId;

    public WalletsIn(IoCheckedScalar<String> walletId) {
        this.walletId = walletId;
    }

    public String getWalletId() {
        return walletId.get();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the `WalletsIn` class does not override any method in the new version of the library. The `IoCheckedScalar` import is also updated to match the changed package name.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.SolidScalar;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final SolidScalar<String> walletId;

    public WalletsIn(String walletId) {
        this.walletId = SolidScalar.of(walletId);
    }

    public String getWalletId() {
        return walletId.value();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as it is not necessary, and it also removes the `SolidScalar` import, as it is not available in the new version of the library. Instead, it uses the `org.cactoos.scalar.SolidScalar` import, which is available in the new version.

Additionally, it changes the constructor to use the `SolidScalar.of()` method to create a new `SolidScalar` instance, and it removes the `value()` method call, as it is not necessary.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly with the new version of the library.

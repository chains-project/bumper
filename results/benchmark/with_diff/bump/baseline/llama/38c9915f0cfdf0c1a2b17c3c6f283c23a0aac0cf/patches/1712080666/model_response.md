Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.cactoos.scalar.IoCheckedScalar;

public class WalletsIn {
    private final IoCheckedScalar<String> scalar;

    public WalletsIn(IoCheckedScalar<String> scalar) {
        this.scalar = scalar;
    }

    public void doIn() {
        scalar.getValue();
    }
}
```
The patch removes the `Override` annotation, as the `doIn()` method is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.
It also imports the `IoCheckedScalar` class, which is now imported from the `org.cactoos.scalar` package.
The constructor of `WalletsIn` now takes an instance of `IoCheckedScalar<String>` as a parameter, and the `doIn()` method now calls the `getValue()` method of the `scalar` instance.
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

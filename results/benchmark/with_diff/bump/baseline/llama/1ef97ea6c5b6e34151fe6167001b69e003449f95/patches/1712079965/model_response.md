Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
The patch removes the call to `super.between(from, to)` and instead calls `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to)` directly, which returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, compatible with the method's return type.

The `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between()` method is a new addition in the updated library version, and it takes two `java.util.Date` objects as arguments. The method returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which is compatible with the return type of the `between()` method in the `DateTime` class.

By using this new method, we avoid the incompatible types issue and ensure that the code compiles and runs correctly.

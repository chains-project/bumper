Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
The patch removes the `super.between(from, to).getTime()` call and instead calls `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to)`.
This is possible because the new library version includes the `++ public java.sql.Timestamp net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(java.sql.Timestamp,java.sql.Timestamp)` method, which can be used to get a `Timestamp` object from two `Date` objects.

The `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between()` method takes two `Date` objects and returns a `Timestamp` object, which is then wrapped in a new `Timestamp` object using the `new Timestamp()` constructor.
This patch should fix the incompatible types error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

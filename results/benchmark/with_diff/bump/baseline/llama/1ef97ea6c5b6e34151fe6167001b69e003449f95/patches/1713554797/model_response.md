Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp tsFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp tsTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(tsFrom, tsTo);
}
```
The patch uses the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between()` method, which is available in the new library version, to replace the call to `super.between(from, to)`. The method takes two `java.sql.Timestamp` arguments and returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object, which is compatible with the return type of the `between()` method.

The `java.util.Date` objects are converted to `java.sql.Timestamp` objects using the `new Timestamp(date.getTime())` constructor.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly with the new library version.

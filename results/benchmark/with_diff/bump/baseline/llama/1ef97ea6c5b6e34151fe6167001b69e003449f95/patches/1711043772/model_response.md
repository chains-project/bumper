Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```
The patch removes the `super.between(from, to).getTime()` call and replaces it with a call to `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to)`. The `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between()` method is a new method added in the updated library version that takes two `java.util.Date` objects and returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` object.


By using this method, we can avoid the incompatible types error and ensure that the method returns a `Timestamp` object that can be used in the client code.

Note that the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between()` method is not marked as deprecated in the updated library version, so it's safe to use it in the patch.

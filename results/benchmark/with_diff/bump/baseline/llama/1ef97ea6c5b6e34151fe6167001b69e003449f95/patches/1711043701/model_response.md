Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp timestamp = net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to);
    return new Timestamp(timestamp.getTime());
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `between()` method in the `net.datafaker.DateAndTime` class has been updated to return a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. To fix the failing client code, we need to adapt the code to use the new return type.

We create a `java.sql.Timestamp` variable `timestamp` and assign it the result of calling `net.datafaker.DateAndTime.between(from, to)`. Then, we create a new `Timestamp` object using the `timestamp` object's `getTime()` method, which returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC), and return it.

Since we're not modifying the method signature, we keep the `@Override` annotation to indicate that we're overriding the `between()` method from the `DateTime` interface.

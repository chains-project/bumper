Here's a proposed patch to fix the failure:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    // ...
    private static final TrustedTagInspector trustedTagInspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
    // ...
}
```
The patch creates a static variable `trustedTagInspector` of type `TrustedTagInspector` and initializes it with a new instance of `TrustedTagInspector()`. This allows the code to use the `TrustedTagInspector` class without any changes to the method signature.

The patch also removes the `Override` decorator from the failing method, as it is not necessary since the method is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still available in the new version of the library, and that the `TrustedTagInspector()` constructor is still accessible. If this is not the case, additional changes may be necessary.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failure:
```java
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.inspector.TrustedTagInspector;

public class AbstractTest {
    // ...
    private void testTrustedTagInspector() {
        // Create a new TrustedTagInspector instance
        TrustedTagInspector inspector = new TrustedTagInspector();
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```
The patch removes the `TrustedTagInspector` constructor call, as it's been removed in the new library version. Instead, we create a new instance of `TrustedTagInspector` using the default constructor.

Note that this patch assumes that the `TrustedTagInspector` class is still being used in the same way in the client code, and that the removal of the constructor doesn't break any other functionality. If this is not the case, a different patch may be necessary.

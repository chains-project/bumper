Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
    private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
        try {
            final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
            registry.setAccessible(true);
            final SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
            DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
            reg.put(contextScope, group);
            registry.set(server, reg);
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
            log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
        }
    }
```

The patch removes the unnecessary `Override` annotation, as the method is not overriding any method in the new version. It also uses the `getRegistry()` method instead of `getSortedMap()` to obtain the `SortedMap` object, as the latter has been removed in the new library version. Finally, it removes the unnecessary `MOScope` parameter from the `DefaultMOContextScope` constructor, as it is not needed in the context of this method.

With these changes, the patch should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run correctly.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Tv.set(Tv. television(Tv.Category.of("jcabi-ssh")));
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` and sets it to a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without any issues.

The `Tv.set()` method is also added to set the `Tv` instance to the `television()` method of the `Tv` class, which is used to set the category of the TV.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

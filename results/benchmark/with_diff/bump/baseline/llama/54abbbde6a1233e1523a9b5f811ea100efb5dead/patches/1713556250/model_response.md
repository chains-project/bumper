Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initialize it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without failing with a `CannotFindSymbol` error.


It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not being removed or modified in the new library version, and that it's still accessible in the same package. If that's not the case, a different approach might be needed.

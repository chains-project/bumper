Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without causing a compile error.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not being used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing it will not cause any issues. If the `Tv` class is being used elsewhere, a different approach may be needed.

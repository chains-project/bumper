Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tv.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without any issues.

The `Tv` class is not removed in the new library version, so it's still available for use. The `Tv` class is also not overriding any method in the new version, so it's safe to remove the `Override` decorator.

With this patch, the code should now compile and run without any errors.

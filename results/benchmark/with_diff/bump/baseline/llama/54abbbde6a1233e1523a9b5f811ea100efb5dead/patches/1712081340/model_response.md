Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Tv.println(" connecting...");
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` and assigns a new instance of `Tv` to it. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without needing to import it directly.


It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is still available in the updated library version, and that it can be used in the same way as before. If the `Tv` class has been removed or modified in a way that makes it incompatible with the code, this patch will not work and a different solution will be needed.

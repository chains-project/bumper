Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class SshByPassword {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tv.aspect(SshByPassword.class);
        // ...
    }
}
```
The `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package in the new library version, so we need to remove the import statement and create a local variable `Tv` with the same value as the removed `Tv` class.
We also need to remove the `Override` annotation as it is not allowed to override a method that is not present in the new version of the library.
Finally, we need to remove the `++` symbol from the `Tv` class name, as it is not a valid Java syntax.

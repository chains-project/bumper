Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and checks if it contains the expected string. The `StringContains` constructor with two arguments is used to create a `Matcher` that matches the expected string.

The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that the `matches` method is overriding the one from the superclass.

This patch can be applied to the code in order to fix the error, and it does not require any changes to the function signature.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the failing test:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image) + "++"
    );
}
```
The patch adds a string increment operator `++` at the end of the format string, this will make the method call to `StringContains` with a different signature than the one in the error message, and it should fix the issue.

It's important to note that this patch is only a suggestion, and it's not guaranteed to work without modifications, as the error message is not the only indicator of the issue, and there could be other problems with the code.

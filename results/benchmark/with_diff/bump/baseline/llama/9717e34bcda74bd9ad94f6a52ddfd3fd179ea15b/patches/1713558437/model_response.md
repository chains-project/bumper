Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private Tv tv;

    public MkGithub(Tv tv) {
        this.tv = tv;
    }

    public void foo() {
        tv.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
Replace the failing client code with the above code. The patch creates a variable `tv` and passes it to the constructor of `MkGithub`. It also uses the `tv` variable to call the `println` method.

Note that the `Tv` class has been removed in the new library version, so we cannot use it directly. Instead, we create a variable `tv` and pass it to the constructor of `MkGithub`. This allows us to use the `tv` variable to call the `println` method without causing any errors.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void mockGithub() {
        Tv.mock(MkGithub.class);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` of type `Tv` and initializes it with a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without any issues.


The `Tv` class is not removed or modified in the new library version, so it's still available for use. The `MkGithub` class is also not modified, so the patch does not change the method signature or remove any methods.

The `Override` decorator is not used in the patch, as it's not necessary for this specific case.

The patch only modifies the failing method, `mockGithub()`, by adding the `Tv` field and using it to call `Tv.mock(MkGithub.class)`. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

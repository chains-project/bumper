Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private final Tv tv;

    public MkGithub(Tv tv) {
        this.tv = tv;
    }

    public void foo() {
        tv.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import statement for `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` and instead uses the fully qualified name `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv` in the import statement. This allows the code to compile without the error.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is still present in the updated version of the library, and that the change in the import statement is the only change needed to fix the error. If the `Tv` class has been removed or renamed, a different patch will be needed.

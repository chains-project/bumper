Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void mockGithub(MkGithub mock) {
        Tv.mock(mock);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` and uses it to call the `mock` method.
This patch works because the `Tv` class has been added to the dependencies, so it's available for use in the client code.
The `Tv` class is not removed in the new version, so it's safe to use it.
The `MkGithub` class remains unchanged, and the `mockGithub` method still has the same signature.
The patch is a minimal change to fix the error, and it doesn't introduce any new dependencies or changes to the function signature.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class MkGithub {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public static void mockGithub(MkGithub moi) {
        Tv.mock(moi);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a private static final field `Tv` and assigns it a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to use the `Tv` class without causing a compile-time error.


Note that the `Tv` class is not removed in the new library version, so we can still use it. Also, we didn't need to remove the `Override` decorator since the method is not overriding any method in the new version.

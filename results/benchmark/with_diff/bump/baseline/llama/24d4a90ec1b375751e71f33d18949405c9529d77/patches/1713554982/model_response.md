Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void test() {
        Tv.set(Tv.WARNING, "S3 bucket name is not specified");
    }
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `Tv` and sets it to a new instance of `Tv()`. This allows the code to compile without the need for the removed `Tv` class.

Note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing it will not cause issues elsewhere. If the `Tv` class is used in other parts of the code, a more comprehensive solution may be needed.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.getInstance();

    // ...
}
```
The patch creates a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and initializes it with the `Tv.getInstance()` method. This allows the code to compile without the need for the `Tv` class to be imported.

Note that the `Tv` class is not used anywhere in the code snippet provided, so it's not clear if this patch actually fixes the underlying issue.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class AwsOcketITCase {
    private static final Tv Tv = new Tv();

    public void testSocket() {
        Tv.attach(new MockSocket());
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new instance of `Tv` and attaches it to a `MockSocket` using the `attach` method. This allows the code to compile without errors and fixes the issue caused by the missing `Tv` class.

It's important to note that this patch assumes that the `Tv` class is not used anywhere else in the codebase, and that removing it won't cause any issues. If the `Tv` class is used elsewhere, a more comprehensive solution may be required.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
The patch removes the import of `TFramedTransport` and instead imports `TTransport` from the same package. It also removes the reference to `TFramedTransport` in the constructor and uses `TTransport` instead. This should fix the error as `TTransport` is still available in the updated version of the library.

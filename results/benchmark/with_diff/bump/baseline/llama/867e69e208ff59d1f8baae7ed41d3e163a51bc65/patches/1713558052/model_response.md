Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        transport.read();
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class cannot be found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. The issue is likely caused by a version mismatch between the client code and the library.


The proposed patch replaces the import statement for `TFramedTransport` with an import statement for `TTransport`, which is a superclass of `TFramedTransport`. This should allow the code to compile without errors.

Additionally, the constructor of `ThriftReader` is modified to accept a `TTransport` object instead of a `TFramedTransport` object. This change ensures that the `ThriftReader` class can work with the updated version of the library.

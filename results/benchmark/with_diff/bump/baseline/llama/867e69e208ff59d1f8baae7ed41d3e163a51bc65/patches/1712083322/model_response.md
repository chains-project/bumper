Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the class `TFramedTransport` cannot be found, which suggests that the library version has changed and the old version is no longer compatible. To fix this issue, we can replace the import statement with `import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;`, which is the updated version of the library.

Additionally, we can remove the `TFramedTransport` import statement as it is no longer needed.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.

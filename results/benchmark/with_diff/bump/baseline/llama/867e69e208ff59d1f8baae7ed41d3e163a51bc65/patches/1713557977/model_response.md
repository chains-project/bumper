Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        TFramedTransport framedTransport = new TFramedTransport(transport);
        // use framedTransport instead of transport
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new `TFramedTransport` instance and uses it instead of the `transport` instance. The `TFramedTransport` class has been added in the new version of the library, so it's available for use. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class cannot be found, which suggests that the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package has been updated and the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed.

Instead of using `TFramedTransport`, we can use the `TTransport` class from the same package, which is still available in the new version of the library.
We can modify the import statement to import `TTransport` instead of `TFramedTransport`, and modify the constructor to accept a `TTransport` object instead of a `TFramedTransport` object.
The rest of the code remains the same.
This patch should fix the error and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class is not found, which suggests that the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package has been updated and the `TFramedTransport` class has been removed.

Instead of using `TFramedTransport`, we can use the `TTransport` class from the same package, which is still available in the new version.
We can modify the constructor to accept a `TTransport` object as a parameter, and remove the `TFramedTransport` import statement.
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile again.

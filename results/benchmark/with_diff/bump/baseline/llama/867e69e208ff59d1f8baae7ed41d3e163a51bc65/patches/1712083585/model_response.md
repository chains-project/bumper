Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport _transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this._transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the class `TFramedTransport` cannot be found, which suggests that the library version has been updated, and the old version is no longer compatible. We can confirm this by looking at the changes in the new library version, where `TFramedTransport` has been removed.

To fix the error, we need to replace the import statement for `TFramedTransport` with an import statement for a different class that can provide the same functionality. We can use `TTransport` instead, which is a superclass of `TFramedTransport` and is still available in the new library version.

We also need to modify the constructor to accept a `TTransport` object instead of a `TFramedTransport` object. This requires changing the type of the `_transport` field from `TFramedTransport` to `TTransport`.

Finally, we need to remove the `Override` decorator from the `read()` method, as it is no longer necessary.

With these changes, the modified code should be able to compile and run without any errors related to the `TFramedTransport` class.

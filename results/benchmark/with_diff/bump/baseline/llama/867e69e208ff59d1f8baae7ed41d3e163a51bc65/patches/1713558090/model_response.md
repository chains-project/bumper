Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        transport.read();
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error message indicates that the `TFramedTransport` class cannot be found in the `org.apache.thrift.transport` package. The new library version includes changes where `TFramedTransport` is removed, and `TTransport` is added. Therefore, we need to replace all instances of `TFramedTransport` with `TTransport`.


In the given code, we import `TFramedTransport`, and we create a variable of type `TFramedTransport` called `transport`. We also have a method called `read()` that calls `transport.read()`.


To fix the error, we replace `TFramedTransport` with `TTransport` in the import statement, variable declaration, and method call. We also remove the `Override` decorator, as it is not necessary.

The resulting code is:
```java
import org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport;

public class ThriftReader {
    private TTransport transport;

    public ThriftReader(TTransport transport) {
        this.transport = transport;
    }

    public void read() {
        transport.read();
    }
}
```
This modified code should compile and run without errors, as it uses only the added library methods and not the removed ones.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    try {
        return new YamlPolicy(
            new BlockingStorage(
                new StoragesLoader().newStorage(
                    sub.string("type"), Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping()
                )
            )
        );
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new `StoragesLoader` instance and uses its `newStorage` method to create a new `Storage` instance, rather than using the removed `Storages` class. The `StoragesLoader` class is a part of the updated library version, and it provides a way to load storage implementations from the classpath.

The `newStorage` method takes two arguments: the first is the type of the storage, and the second is a `YamlMapping` object that contains the configuration for the storage. The `YamlMapping` object is created from the `sub` `PolicyConfig` object using the `Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping()` method.

By using the `StoragesLoader` class, we avoid the need for the removed `Storages` class and instead use the updated library version's way of loading storage implementations. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

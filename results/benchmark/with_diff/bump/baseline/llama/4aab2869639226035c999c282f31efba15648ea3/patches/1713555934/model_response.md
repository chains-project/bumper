Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private static final Storages STORAGES = new StoragesLoader().load();

    public static com.artipie.asto.Storage newStorage(com.artipie.asto.factory.Config config) {
        return STORAGES.newStorage(config);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `Storages` class has been removed from the latest version of the library. To fix this, we can use the `StoragesLoader` class, which is a new addition to the library, to load the `Storages` instance. We can then use this instance to create a new storage object using the `newStorage` method.

Note that we're also using the `com.artipie.asto.factory.Config` class instead of `com.artipie.asto.factory.StorageConfig` as the parameter for the `newStorage` method, as the latter has been removed from the latest version of the library.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.artipie.asto.factory.Storages;

public class YamlPolicyFactory {
    private static final Storages STORAGES = new StoragesLoader().load();

    public static Policy loadPolicy(YamlMapping yaml) {
        return new YamlPolicy(yaml, STORAGES.newStorage(new StorageConfig()));
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The error is caused by the fact that the `Storages` class has been removed from the new version of the library. To fix this, we can use the `StoragesLoader` class, which is a new addition to the library, to load the `Storages` instance. We can then use this instance to create a new `Storage` object using the `newStorage` method.

The `StoragesLoader` class takes a `Map` parameter in its constructor, but it is not used in this case, so we can pass an empty map.

The `StoragesLoader.load()` method returns a `Storages` instance, which we can assign to a field to use it later.

The rest of the code remains the same, as it does not depend on the removed `Storages` class.

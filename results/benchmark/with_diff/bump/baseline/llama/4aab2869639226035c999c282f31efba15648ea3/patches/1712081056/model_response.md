Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    try {
        return new YamlPolicy(
            new BlockingStorage(
                new StoragesLoader().newObject(sub.string("type"), Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping())
            )
        );
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```
The patch removes the usage of `Storages` class, which is no longer available in the updated library version. Instead, it uses the `StoragesLoader` class to create a new `Storage` instance.
The `StoragesLoader` class is a new addition to the library, and it provides a way to create a `Storage` instance from a configuration.
The `newObject` method is used to create a new `Storage` instance from a configuration, and it takes two parameters: the type of the storage, and the configuration to use.
In this case, the type of the storage is specified using the `sub.string("type")` method, and the configuration is created using the `Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping()` method.
This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly with the updated library version.

Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@Override
public Policy<?> getPolicy(final PolicyConfig config) {
    final PolicyConfig sub = config.config("storage");
    try {
        return new YamlPolicy(
            new BlockingStorage(
                new StoragesLoader().newStorage(
                    sub.string("type"), Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping()
                )
            )
        );
    } catch (final IOException err) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(err);
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new `StoragesLoader` instance to retrieve the `Storage` instance, as the `Storages` class has been removed. The `StoragesLoader` class is used to load the storage configurations from the `asto` module.

Additionally, the `YamlPolicy` constructor has been updated to use the `Yaml.createYamlInput(sub.toString()).readYamlMapping()` method to read the YAML configuration, as the `YamlPolicy` class is not able to handle the `YamlMapping` constructor.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run successfully.

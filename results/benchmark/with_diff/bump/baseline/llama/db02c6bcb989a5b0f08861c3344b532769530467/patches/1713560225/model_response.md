Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
private static Matcher<String> imagePulled(final String image) {
    return new StringContains(
        false,
        String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image)
    ) {
        @Override
        public boolean matches(String s) {
            return s.contains("Downloaded newer image for " + image);
        }
    };
}
```
The patch creates an anonymous subclass of `StringContains` and overrides the `matches` method to fix the error. The `matches` method takes a `String` argument and checks if it contains the expected string. The `StringContains` constructor with two arguments is used to create a `Matcher` that matches the expected string.

The `Override` decorator is used to indicate that the `matches` method is overriding the one in the superclass. The `StringContains` class is imported from the `org.hamcrest.core` package, which is part of the JUnit framework.

The patch does not remove or add any methods, and it does not change the function signature. It only modifies the implementation of the `imagePulled` method to fix the error.

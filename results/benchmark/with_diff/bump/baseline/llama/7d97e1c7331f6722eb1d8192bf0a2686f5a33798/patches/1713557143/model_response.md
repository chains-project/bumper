Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.NULL;
    // ...
}
```
The `Tv` class has been removed from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package in the new library version, so we need to replace the import statement with a static final variable that holds a `Tv` instance. We can set it to `Tv.NULL` to avoid any issues.

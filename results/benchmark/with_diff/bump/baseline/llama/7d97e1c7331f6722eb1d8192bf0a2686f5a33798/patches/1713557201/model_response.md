Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
  private static final Tv TV = Tv.NULL;

  public void testSomething() {
    // your code here
  }
}
```
The patch adds a static final field `TV` of type `Tv` and initializes it with `Tv.NULL`. This allows the code to compile without the need for the `Tv` class, which has been removed in the new library version.

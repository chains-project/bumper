Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv;

public class RegionITCase {
    private static final Tv TV = Tv.getInstance();

    @org.junit.Test
    public void testRegion() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
The patch involves importing the `Tv` class from the `com.jcabi.aspects` package and creating a static instance of it named `TV`. The instance is then used in the `testRegion()` method.

This patch should fix the error by providing a valid reference to the `Tv` class, which is now imported and available in the code.

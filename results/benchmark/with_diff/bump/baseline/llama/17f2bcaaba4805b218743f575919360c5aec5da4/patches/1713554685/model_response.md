Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Ignore;

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    @Ignore
    public void testPolygonize() {
        //TODO: Add test implementation
    }
}
```
The `Ignore` annotation is not recognized because it has been removed in the new library version. To fix the error, we can replace `org.junit.Ignore` with `org.junit.jupiter.api.Ignored`, which is a new annotation added in the new version of the library.

Note that we cannot remove the `Override` decorator because the `testPolygonize()` method is not overriding any method in the new version of the library.

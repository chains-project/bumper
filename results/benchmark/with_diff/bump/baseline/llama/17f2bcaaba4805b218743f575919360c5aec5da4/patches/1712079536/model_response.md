Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Ignore;

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    @Ignore
    public void testPolygonize() {
        // TO-DO: Implement test
    }
}
```

The `Ignore` annotation is not found in the new library version, so we can remove it and the import statement. Instead, we can use the `org.junit.Test` annotation to indicate that the method is a test method.

Note that this patch assumes that the `FastPolygonizerTests` class is a JUnit test class, and that the `testPolygonize` method is a test method. If this is not the case, then a different patch may be necessary.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.junit.Ignore;

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    @Ignore
    public void testPolygonize() {
        // TODO: Implement polygonize method
    }
}
```
The `Ignore` annotation is not recognized in the new library version, so we can remove it and add a comment to explain that the method is not implemented yet.

Alternatively, we can also keep the `Ignore` annotation and add a comment to explain that it's not recognized in the new library version:
```java
import org.junit.Ignore;

public class FastPolygonizerTests {
    @Ignore
    // @Ignore is not recognized in the new library version
    public void testPolygonize() {
        // TODO: Implement polygonize method
    }
}
```
Both versions should compile and run without errors.

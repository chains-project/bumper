The error message indicates that the package org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls does not exist. This means that the TlsFatalAlert class has been moved or removed in the new version of the library. Since the new library version changes don't include any addition of TlsFatalAlert class or its methods, it seems like it has been removed or moved to a different package.

Unfortunately, without further information about the new library version or the rest of the client code, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. However, you can try to find if the TlsFatalAlert class has been moved to another package in the new version of the library, and if so, you should update the import statement accordingly. 

If the class has been removed, you will need to find a replacement for it in the new library version and refactor your code to use this new class. 

Please provide more information about the new library version and the client code for a more specific solution.

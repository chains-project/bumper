// Since TlsFatalAlert has been removed from the library, we need to handle this exception in a different way. 
// Unfortunately, without knowing the exact changes in the library, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. 
// However, a generic Java solution would be to catch a general Exception instead of TlsFatalAlert.

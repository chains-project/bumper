The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist. This could be due to the removal of the package or class in the new version of the library. Since there's no information about the addition of a similar package or class in the new version, it's impossible to provide an alternative import statement. 

Therefore, the patch would be to simply remove the import statement:

```java
  // import org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls.AlertDescription;
```

This will fix the compilation error, but you may encounter other issues if the `AlertDescription` class was used in your code. You'll need to find a replacement for this class in the new version of the library or refactor your code to not use it.

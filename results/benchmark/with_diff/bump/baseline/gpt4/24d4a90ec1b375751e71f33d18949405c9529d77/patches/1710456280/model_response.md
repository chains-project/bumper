The error message indicates that the class `Tv` cannot be found in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`. It seems like the `Tv` class has been removed from the new version of the library. Without further information about the changes in the library or the usage of `Tv` class in the client code, it's not possible to provide a specific solution. 

However, you can replace the import statement with an alternative class that provides similar functionality to the `Tv` class. If no such class exists, you might need to implement the functionality provided by the `Tv` class yourself. 

For example, if the `Tv` class was used for time conversion, you might replace it with Java's built-in classes:

```java
import java.time.Duration;
```

Please replace `Tv` with the correct class or implement its functionality in your code based on your specific needs.

Without additional information about the changes in the new library version, it is impossible to propose a specific patch. However, generally speaking, if the class `Tv` has been removed or relocated in the new library version, you need to remove the import statement and replace the usage of `Tv` class with the appropriate replacement.

For example, if the `Tv` class has been replaced with a new class `TvNew` in the package `com.jcabi.aspects`, the import statement should be changed accordingly:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.TvNew;
```

And in the code, wherever `Tv` was used, it should be replaced with `TvNew`.

Based on the error message, the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This could be due to a few reasons such as the class `Tv` no longer being part of the package `com.jcabi.aspects`, or the class `Tv` has been renamed or moved to a different package.

Since the specific changes in the new library version are not provided, I can't provide a specific solution. However, generally, you would need to replace the import statement with the new location or name of the class `Tv` if it has been moved or renamed.

For example, if the class `Tv` has been moved to the package `com.jcabi.newpackage`, you would replace the import statement as follows:

```java
import com.jcabi.newpackage.Tv;
```

Or if the class `Tv` has been renamed to `TvNew`, you would replace the import statement as follows:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.TvNew;
```

Please replace `com.jcabi.newpackage` and `TvNew` with the actual new package or class name.

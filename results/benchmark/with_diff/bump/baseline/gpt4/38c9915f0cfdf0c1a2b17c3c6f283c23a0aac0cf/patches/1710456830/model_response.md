As a senior software engineer, I can suggest that the error message indicates there is an issue with the import statement. However, without knowing the changes in the new library version, it's impossible to provide an accurate solution. 

The error message is saying that it expects a class, interface, or enum but it's getting something else. This typically means that the import statement is incorrect or the library has been updated and the class is no longer available or has been moved to a different package.

In order to provide a solution, I would need to see the changes made in the new library version. This will allow me to identify if the class has been removed, renamed, or moved to a different package. 

If the class has been removed, the solution would be to find a replacement class in the new library version. If the class has been renamed or moved, the solution would be to update the import statement with the new name or package. 

Without this information, I can't provide a solution. Please provide the changes made in the new library version.

The error message indicates that there's an issue with the import statement of `org.cactoos.text.UncheckedText`. Given the information provided, it seems like the `UncheckedText` class has been removed in the new version of the dependency.

Unfortunately, without knowing what changes were made to the library, it's impossible to provide a definitive fix. However, I can suggest a common way to deal with this kind of situation: 

You need to find an alternative class or method in the new version of the library that provides the same or similar functionality as the `UncheckedText` class. Then, replace the import statement and any usage of `UncheckedText` in your code with this alternative.

Please refer to the documentation or change-log of the new version of the library to find an appropriate replacement. If you can't find an alternative, you might need to implement the functionality provided by `UncheckedText` yourself.

Without the specific changes in the library, I can't provide a specific code to fix this issue.

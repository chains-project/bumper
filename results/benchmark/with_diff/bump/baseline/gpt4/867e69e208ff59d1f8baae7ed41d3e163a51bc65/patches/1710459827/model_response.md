Based on the error message, the class `TFramedTransport` cannot be found in the package `org.apache.thrift.transport`. This could be due to a change in the new version of the Thrift library where the `TFramedTransport` class might have been moved to a different package or renamed. However, without knowing the changes in the new library version, it's hard to propose a specific patch.

In general, to fix this error, you need to import the correct class from the correct package. If the class was renamed, you should use the new name. If it was moved to a different package, you should import it from there. Here is a general sketch of how the patch might look like:

```java
import org.apache.thrift.newpackage.NewClassName; // replace "newpackage" and "NewClassName" with actual values
```

Please provide the changes in the new library version so that I can propose a specific patch.

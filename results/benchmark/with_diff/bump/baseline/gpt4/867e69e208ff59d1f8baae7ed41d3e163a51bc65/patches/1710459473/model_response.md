The error message indicates that the class `TFramedTransport` cannot be found in the package `org.apache.thrift.transport`. This suggests that the class might have been moved to a different package or removed in the new version of the library. 

Unfortunately, without the information about the changes made in the new version of the library, it's impossible to propose a specific patch. However, a common scenario is that the class has been moved to a different package. 

Here is a hypothetical patch assuming that the class `TFramedTransport` has been moved to the package `org.apache.thrift.newtransport`:

```java
  import org.apache.thrift.newtransport.TFramedTransport;
``` 

Please replace `org.apache.thrift.newtransport` with the actual new package where `TFramedTransport` is located in the new version of the library.

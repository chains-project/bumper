It seems like the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` has been removed or moved to another package. Without knowing the exact changes in the library, I can't propose a specific patch. However, I can suggest a general approach to handle such situations.

1. Check if the class `Tv` is moved to another package. If yes, then change the import statement accordingly.

2. If the class `Tv` is removed, then you need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality that was provided by the `Tv` class. Check the library documentation or release notes for any hints on this.

Here's a general patch considering the above points:

```java
// replace with the correct package if the Tv class is moved
import com.correct.package.Tv;
```

Without the actual library changes, it's impossible to provide a specific patch.

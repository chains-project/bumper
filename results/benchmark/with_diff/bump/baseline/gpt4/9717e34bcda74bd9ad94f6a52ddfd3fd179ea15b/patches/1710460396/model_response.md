As the error message indicates that the class Tv cannot be found in the package com.jcabi.aspects, it seems that the class Tv has been removed from the new version of the library. Without information about the changes in the new version of the library, it's hard to provide a specific solution.

However, a general solution would be to replace the usage of the Tv class with equivalent functionality provided by the new version of the library or Java itself. If Tv was used for time conversion, for example, we could use java.time classes instead.

If Tv was not used in the client code, the import statement could simply be removed. Here's the patched code in this case:

```java
// import com.jcabi.aspects.Tv; removed
```

Please provide more information about the usage of the Tv class and the changes in the new version of the library for a more specific solution.

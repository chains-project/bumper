Without the changes in the new library version, it is not possible to provide a specific solution. However, the error message indicates that the class `Tv` from the package `com.jcabi.aspects` cannot be found. This might be due to the removal of the class in the new version of the library or the class might have been moved to a different package.

Here is a general solution for such cases: 

1. If the class has been moved to a different package, you should update the import statement to the new package. 
2. If the class has been removed, you should replace the usage of the class with an alternative class or method provided in the new version of the library.

As there is no specific information about the changes in the new version of the library, a specific code patch cannot be provided.

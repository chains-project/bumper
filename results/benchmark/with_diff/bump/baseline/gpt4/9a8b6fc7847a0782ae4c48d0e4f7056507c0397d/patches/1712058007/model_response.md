```java
  import org.jasypt.spring.security.PBEPasswordEncoder;
```
This import statement fails because the class PBEPasswordEncoder does not exist in the package org.jasypt.spring.security in the new version of the library. Since no replacement class or methods are provided in the library changes, we cannot provide a fix for this issue.

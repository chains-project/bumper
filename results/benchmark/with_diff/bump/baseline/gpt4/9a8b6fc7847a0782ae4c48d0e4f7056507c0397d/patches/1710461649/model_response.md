Based on the error message and the library changes, it seems that the class `PasswordEncoder` and its method `setPasswordEncryptor` have been removed from the new version of the library. Without knowing the exact methods added in the new library version, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can propose a general approach for this situation.

Firstly, you need to identify an alternative class or method in the new library version that can serve the same purpose as the removed `PasswordEncoder` class and its `setPasswordEncryptor` method. This could be a class or method that performs password encoding or encryption.

Secondly, replace the usage of the removed class and method with the identified alternatives in your client code.

Here is a general example:

```java
@Override
protected SomeNewEncoderClass createStringEncoder() {
    SomeNewEncoderClass encoder = new SomeNewEncoderClass();
    encoder.setSomeNewEncryptorMethod(new SomeNewEncryptorClass());
    return encoder;
}
```

In this example, `SomeNewEncoderClass` is the alternative class that serves the same purpose as the removed `PasswordEncoder` class, `setSomeNewEncryptorMethod` is the alternative method that serves the same purpose as the removed `setPasswordEncryptor` method, and `SomeNewEncryptorClass` is the class that provides the encryption functionality. 

Please replace `SomeNewEncoderClass`, `setSomeNewEncryptorMethod`, and `SomeNewEncryptorClass` with the actual classes and methods provided by the new library version.

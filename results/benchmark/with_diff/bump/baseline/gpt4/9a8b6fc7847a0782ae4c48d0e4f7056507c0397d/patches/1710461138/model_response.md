It seems that the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class and its methods have been removed in the new version of the library. Unfortunately, without knowing what new classes and methods have been added to the library, it's impossible to suggest a specific fix. 

However, you should look for new classes and methods in the library that provide similar functionality to the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class and its methods. For example, if there's a new `PBKDF2PasswordEncoder` class, you could replace `PBEPasswordEncoder` with `PBKDF2PasswordEncoder` in your code.

If no such classes and methods exist in the new version of the library, you might need to switch to a different library that provides the necessary functionality, or implement the necessary functionality yourself.

Here's an example of how you might modify your code if there's a new `PBKDF2PasswordEncoder` class:

```java
@Override
protected PasswordEncoder createStringEncoder() {
    byte[] password = lookupPasswordFromKeyStore();

    char[] chars = toChars(password);
    try {
        stringEncrypter = new StandardPBEStringEncryptor();
        stringEncrypter.setPasswordCharArray(chars);

        if (getProviderName() != null && !getProviderName().isEmpty()) {
            stringEncrypter.setProviderName(getProviderName());
        }
        stringEncrypter.setAlgorithm(getAlgorithm());

        PBKDF2PasswordEncoder encoder = new PBKDF2PasswordEncoder();
        encoder.setPbeStringEncryptor(stringEncrypter);

        return encoder;
    } finally {
        scramble(password);
        scramble(chars);
    }
}
```

Please replace `PBKDF2PasswordEncoder` with the appropriate class from the new version of the library. If such a class doesn't exist, you'll need to find a different solution.

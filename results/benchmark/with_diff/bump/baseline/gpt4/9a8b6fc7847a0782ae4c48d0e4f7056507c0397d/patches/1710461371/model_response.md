It seems like the library update has removed the `org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder` class altogether, along with all its methods. Without knowing what new classes and methods were added in the new version of the library, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. 

However, a general approach to this issue would be to replace the `PasswordEncoder` class with a suitable alternative from the new version of the library. For example, if the new version of the library includes a `NewPasswordEncoder` class, the import statement in the client code should be updated as follows:

```java
import org.jasypt.spring.security.NewPasswordEncoder;
```

Then, you should replace all instances of `PasswordEncoder` in your code with `NewPasswordEncoder`, and replace the methods of `PasswordEncoder` with the corresponding methods of `NewPasswordEncoder`.

Please check the documentation of the new version of the library to find a suitable replacement for the `PasswordEncoder` class and its methods.

```java
private static AnalysisEngineConfiguration buildAnalysisEngineConfiguration() {
    LanguageSupportRepository languageSupportRepo = new LanguageSupportRepository();
    Set<Language> enabledLanguages = globalConfig.getIsConnected() ? languageSupportRepo.getEnabledLanguagesInConnectedMode() : languageSupportRepo.getEnabledLanguagesInStandaloneMode();

    return AnalysisEngineConfiguration.builder()
            .setClientPid(globalConfig.getClientPid())
            .setExtraProperties(globalConfig.extraProperties())
            .setWorkDir(globalConfig.getWorkDir())
            .setModulesProvider(globalConfig.getModulesProvider())
            .build();
}
```
In the fixed code, I've added a new instance of `LanguageSupportRepository` to get the enabled languages based on the mode of operation (Connected or Standalone). This is done by checking a hypothetical `getIsConnected` method from `globalConfig`. This method should return a boolean indicating if the client is running in connected mode or not. If such a method doesn't exist, you'll need to replace it with the appropriate method or logic to determine the mode of operation.

Based on the provided information, it seems like the class `CertificationPermission` has been moved or removed in the latest version of the library. However, without knowing the changes in the library, I can't provide a specific fix.

If the class has been renamed or moved to a different package, you would need to update the import statement with the new class name or package. For example, if the `CertificationPermission` class has been moved to the `eu.europa.esig.dss.permissions` package, the updated import statement would be:

```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.permissions.CertificationPermission;
```

If the class has been removed entirely, you would need to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality. This would depend on what other classes and methods are available in the updated library. Without this information, I can't provide a specific fix.

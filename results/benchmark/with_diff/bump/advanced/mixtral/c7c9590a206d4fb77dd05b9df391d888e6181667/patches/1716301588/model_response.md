Here is the proposed patch:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext object.
        // You might need to access some properties or methods from the original RenderingContext object.
        // If so, make sure to update the import statement accordingly.
    }
};

// Use the 'renderingContext' object instead of the original RenderingContext object.
```

Note that you might need to modify the implementation of the `getOutputName()` method based on the original usage of the `RenderingContext` object. You might also need to access some properties or methods from the original `RenderingContext` object. If so, make sure to update the import statement accordingly.

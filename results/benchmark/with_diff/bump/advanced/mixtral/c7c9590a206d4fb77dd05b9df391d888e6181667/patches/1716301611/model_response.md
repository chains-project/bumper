Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.lang.String;

// ...

public void someMethod() {
  // ...
  RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
      // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext object.
      // For example, you can return null if the original code didn't use this method.
      return null;
    }
  };

  // Use the renderingContext object as before.
  // ...
}
```
In the new library version, the `RenderingContext` class is no longer an abstract class, so you can create an instance of it directly. However, you might need to implement some of its methods if they are called in the client code. In this example, I assumed that the `getOutputName()` method is not used in the client code, so I returned null. You might need to adjust the implementation based on the actual usage of the `RenderingContext` object in the client code.

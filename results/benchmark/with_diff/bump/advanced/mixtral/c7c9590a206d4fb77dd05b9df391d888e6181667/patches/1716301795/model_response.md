Here is a patch that you can apply to the code to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement this method based on the original usage of the RenderingContext object.
        // You may need to modify the code that uses the renderingContext object to accommodate for the missing methods.
    }
};

// Use the "renderingContext" object instead of creating it directly using the constructor.
```
Note that you will need to modify the code that uses the `RenderingContext` object to accommodate for the missing methods. In particular, you will need to implement the `getOutputName()` method based on the original usage of the `RenderingContext` object.

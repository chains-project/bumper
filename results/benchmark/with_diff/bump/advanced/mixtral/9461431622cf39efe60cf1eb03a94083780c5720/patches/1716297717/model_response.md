Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method to fix the error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes made include:

* Replacing the `SortedMap` type of the `reg` variable with the raw `Map` type, which should be compatible with both the old and new library versions.
* Replacing the `reg` variable when setting it back to the registry, by creating a new `TreeMap` instance from the updated `reg` map. This ensures that the registry remains sorted, as required by the `SortedMap` interface.

Note that this patch assumes that the order of the registry entries is not important, as long as they are sorted. If the order of the entries is important, a different solution may be necessary.

Here's a fixed version of the client code that should resolve the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.model.Model;
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Change the type of project to Model, which is a superinterface of MavenProject
public void someMethod(Model project) {
    // Existing code using project
}
```
Explanation:
The error message indicates that the `org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject` package is not found. This suggests that the `maven-project` artifact is either not present in the project's dependencies, or it has been removed in the new library version.

To fix this, we can change the type of the `project` parameter from `MavenProject` to `Model`, which is a superinterface of `MavenProject`. This way, we can still use the methods of `MavenProject` through the `Model` interface.

Note that this solution assumes that the methods of `MavenProject` that are used in the original code are also present in the `Model` interface. If this is not the case, further modifications to the code may be necessary.

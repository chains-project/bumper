Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import tokyo.peya.lib.*;
```
This patch imports the new package name for the external library, which has been changed from `develop.p2p.lib` to `tokyo.peya.lib`. This should fix the error message `develop.p2p.lib does not exist` and allow the client code to compile and run successfully.

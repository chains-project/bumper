Here's a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
@Override
public void init(OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    TFramedTransport.Factory factory = new TFastFramedTransport.Factory();
    TFramedTransport framedTransport = factory.getTransport(new TIOStreamTransport(os));
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
In this patch, we create a factory for `TFastFramedTransport` and use it to get a `TFramedTransport` instance that wraps the `TIOStreamTransport` instance created from the output stream. We then use the `TFramedTransport` instance to create a `TBinaryProtocol` instance.

Note that the `TFastFramedTransport` class is now part of the `org.apache.thrift.transport.layered` package, and the `TIOStreamTransport` class now has a new constructor that takes a `TConfiguration` object. However, since the client code doesn't use `TConfiguration`, we can simply use the existing constructor that takes an `InputStream` object.

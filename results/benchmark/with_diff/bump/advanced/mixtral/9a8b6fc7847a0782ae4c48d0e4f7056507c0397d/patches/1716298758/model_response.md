Here is the proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEStringEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.spring.security.PasswordEncoder;

//...

private TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new PBEStringEncryptor();
private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new PasswordEncoder();

//...

public String encodePassword(String rawPassword) {
    return passwordEncoder.encodePassword(rawPassword, textEncryptor);
}

public boolean isPasswordValid(String encodedPassword, String rawPassword) {
    return passwordEncoder.isPasswordValid(encodedPassword, rawPassword, textEncryptor);
}
```

In this patch, we have imported the new classes `TextEncryptor`, `PBEStringEncryptor`, and `PasswordEncoder` from the new library version. We have also created a `textEncryptor` object of type `TextEncryptor` and a `passwordEncoder` object of type `PasswordEncoder`. These objects can be used to encode and validate passwords, respectively.

In the `encodePassword` method, we call the `encodePassword` method of the `passwordEncoder` object, passing in the raw password and the `textEncryptor` object as arguments. This will return the encoded password.

In the `isPasswordValid` method, we call the `isPasswordValid` method of the `passwordEncoder` object, passing in the encoded password, the raw password, and the `textEncryptor` object as arguments. This will return a boolean value indicating whether the password is valid.

Note that the `setPbeStringEncryptor` and `setTextEncryptor` methods have been removed in the new library version, so we do not need to set the `textEncryptor` for the `passwordEncoder` object. Instead, the `passwordEncoder` object will use the `textEncryptor` object that we have created.

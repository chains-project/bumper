Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(new Timestamp(from.getTime()), new Timestamp(to.getTime())).getTime());
}
```

The change here is to convert the input `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before passing them to the superclass's `between` method. This is necessary because the superclass's `between` method now expects `Timestamp` arguments instead of `Date` arguments.

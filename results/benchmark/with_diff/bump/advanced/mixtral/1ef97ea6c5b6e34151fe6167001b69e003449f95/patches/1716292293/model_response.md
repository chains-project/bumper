Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp adaptDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return adaptDateToTimestamp(super.between(adaptDateToTimestamp(from), adaptDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` objects returned by the superclass to `Timestamp` objects before returning them. This is necessary because the superclass's `between` method now returns a `Timestamp` instead of a `Date`. The `adaptDateToTimestamp` method is used to simplify the conversion.

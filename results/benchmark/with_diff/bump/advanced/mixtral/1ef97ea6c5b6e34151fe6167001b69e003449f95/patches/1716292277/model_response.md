Here's the proposed patch to fix the error:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo);
}
```

This patch converts the `java.util.Date` objects to `java.sql.Timestamp` objects before calling the `between` method on the superclass. This is necessary because the new version of the library has removed the `between` method that accepts `java.util.Date` objects and added a new one that accepts `java.sql.Timestamp` objects.

Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertDateToTimestamp(from), convertDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

Explanation:

The issue is that the `between` method in the superclass now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. To fix this, we can create a helper method `convertDateToTimestamp` that converts a `Date` to a `Timestamp`. We can then use this helper method to convert the `Date` objects returned by the superclass's `between` method to `Timestamp` objects before returning them.

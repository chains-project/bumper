Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertDateToTimestamp(from), convertDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

Explanation:

* The original method signature cannot be changed, so I created a new private method `convertDateToTimestamp` that converts a `Date` object to a `Timestamp` object.
* I then modified the original method to use the new `convertDateToTimestamp` method to convert the `Date` objects returned by the superclass method to `Timestamp` objects before returning.
* This ensures that the method returns a `Timestamp` object, which is compatible with the method's return type, and avoids the incompatible types error.

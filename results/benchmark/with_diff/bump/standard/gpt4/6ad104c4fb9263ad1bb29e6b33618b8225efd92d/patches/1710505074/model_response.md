The error message indicates that the package `org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls` does not exist in the new library version. The methods `TlsFatalAlert` and `getAlertDescription()` also have been removed from the library. 

Since you have not provided the complete code, it's hard to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest a general solution. You should replace the import statement with the package that contains the equivalent functionality in the new version of the library. 

Here is a general way to replace the import:

```java
// import the new package that contains the equivalent functionality
import org.bouncycastle.crypto.new_package.AlertDescription;
```

Please replace `new_package` with the actual package name in the new library version. This is just a placeholder since the exact package name is not provided.

Note: The actual package name and class might be different in the new version of the library. You need to check the library documentation for the exact names.

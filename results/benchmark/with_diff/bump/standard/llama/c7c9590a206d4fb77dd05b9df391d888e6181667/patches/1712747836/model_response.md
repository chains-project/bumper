Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.module.xhtml.decoration.render.RenderingContext;

public class SCoverageReportMojo {
    private RenderingContext renderingContext;

    public SCoverageReportMojo() {
        this.renderingContext = new RenderingContext();
    }

    public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException {
        // ...
    }

    public RenderingContext getRenderingContext() {
        return renderingContext;
    }
}
```
The patch creates a new `RenderingContext` instance and assigns it to a field in the `SCoverageReportMojo` class. The `getRenderingContext()` method is added to provide access to the `RenderingContext` instance.


The `RenderingContext` class is not modified, so the patch does not change its behavior. The patch only provides a way to create a `RenderingContext` instance that can be used by the `SCoverageReportMojo` class.


The patch does not use any removed library methods, and it does not change the function signature of any method. It only adds a new method and a field to the `SCoverageReportMojo` class.


The patch should be applicable to the failing client code, and it should fix the error caused by the missing `RenderingContext` class.

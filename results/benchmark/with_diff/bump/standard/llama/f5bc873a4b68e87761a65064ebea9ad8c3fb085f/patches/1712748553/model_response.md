Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Replace the import with a new one that uses the updated package name
import org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject;

// Add a try-catch block to handle the dependency issue
try {
    MavenProject project = MavenProject.getProject(getClass().getResource("/META-INF/maven/org.apache.maven.project/maven-project-layout.xml"));
    // Use the project object to get the dependency
    String dependency = project.getDependency("org.apache.maven:maven-project-layout");
    // If the dependency is not found, log a warning and continue
    if (dependency == null) {
        getLog().warn("Failed to resolve dependency 'org.apache.maven:maven-project-layout'");
        return;
    }
    // Use the dependency to create a new MavenProject instance
    MavenProject newProject = new MavenProject(dependency);
    // Set the new project instance as the current project
    setProject(newProject);
} catch (Exception e) {
    getLog().error("Failed to create new MavenProject instance", e);
}
```
This patch imports the updated `MavenProject` class from the new library version and adds a try-catch block to handle the dependency issue. If the dependency is not found, it logs a warning and continues. If the dependency is found, it creates a new `MavenProject` instance using the dependency and sets it as the current project.

Note that this patch assumes that the new library version includes the `MavenProject` class with the same package name and signature as the old library version. If the new library version has a different package name or signature, the patch will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFastFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new org.apache.thrift.TConfiguration());
    transport.open();
    framedTransport = new TFastFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
The patch creates a new `TIOStreamTransport` instance using the `TConfiguration` class, and then wraps it with a `TFastFramedTransport` instance using the `bufferCapacity` parameter. The `TIOStreamTransport` instance is created with an empty configuration, which should not cause any issues since the `TFastFramedTransport` instance will take care of the buffering.

The `TFastFramedTransport` instance is created with the `TIOStreamTransport` instance and the `bufferCapacity` parameter. This should fix the error and allow the code to compile and run correctly.

Note that the `TFastFramedTransport$Factory` class has been removed, so we cannot use it to create a `TFastFramedTransport` instance. Instead, we create a `TIOStreamTransport` instance and wrap it with a `TFastFramedTransport` instance.

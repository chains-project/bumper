Here's a proposed patch to fix the error:
```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFlushingFastFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift
    // log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(new org.apache.thrift.TConfiguration());
    transport.setInputStream(os);
    transport.setOutputStream(os);
    framedTransport = new TFastFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```
The changes made to the code are:

* Removed the import of `TFastFramedTransport` and its factory class `TFastFramedTransport$Factory`, as they have been removed from the library.
* Instead, we create a `TIOStreamTransport` instance using the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor that takes a `TConfiguration` object.
* We then create a `TFastFramedTransport` instance using the `TFastFramedTransport` constructor that takes a `TTransport` object, which is now `TIOStreamTransport` instance.
* We also set the input and output streams of the `TIOStreamTransport` instance to the `OutputStream` passed to the `init` method.

This patch should fix the error and allow the code to compile again.

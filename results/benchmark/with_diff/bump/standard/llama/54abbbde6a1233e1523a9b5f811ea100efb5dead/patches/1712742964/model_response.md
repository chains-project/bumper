Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```diff
-@java.lang.Override
-@com.jcabi.aspects.RetryOnFailure(attempts = Tv.SEVEN, delay = 1, unit = java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MINUTES, verbose = false, types = java.io.IOException.class)
+@java.lang.Override
+@com.jcabi.aspects.RetryOnFailure(attempts = 7, delay = 1, unit = java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MINUTES, verbose = false, types = java.io.IOException.class)
```
The patch removes the reference to `Tv` and sets the `attempts` parameter to a hardcoded value of 7.

The error was caused by the removal of the `Tv` class in the new library version. By removing the reference to `Tv` and hardcoding the value, the error is fixed.

Here's a possible patch to fix the error:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncoder;

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {
    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    public GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder() {
        passwordEncoder = new PasswordEncoder();
    }

    public String encodePassword(String password, Object salt) {
        return passwordEncoder.encodePassword(password, salt);
    }

    public boolean isPasswordValid(String password, String encodedPassword, Object salt) {
        return passwordEncoder.isPasswordValid(password, encodedPassword, salt);
    }

    public void setPasswordEncryptor(org.jasypt.util.password.PasswordEncryptor encryptor) {
        passwordEncoder.setPasswordEncryptor(encryptor);
    }

    public void setStringDigester(org.jasypt.digest.StringDigester digester) {
        passwordEncoder.setStringDigester(digester);
    }
}
```
This patch replaces the entire `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class with a new implementation that uses the `PasswordEncoder` class from the `org.jasypt.util.password` package, which is a different package than the one that was removed. The `PasswordEncoder` class has the same methods as the `PBEPasswordEncoder` class that was removed, so the patch should fix the error.

Note that this patch assumes that the `org.jasypt.util.password` package is available in the classpath. If it's not, you'll need to add the necessary dependencies to your project.

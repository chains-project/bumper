Here's a proposed patch for the `registerHard` method that fixes the type mismatch error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes made include:

* Replacing the `SortedMap` type with the raw `Map` type for the `reg` variable. This is safe because the `put` method of `Map` has a covariant return type, so the result can be assigned to a `SortedMap` variable.
* Creating a new `TreeMap` (which implements `SortedMap`) from the `reg` map before setting it as the new value of the `registry` field. This is necessary because the `registry` field is declared as a `SortedMap`, and the type mismatch error is caused by the fact that the original `reg` map is not a `SortedMap`. By creating a new `TreeMap` from `reg`, we ensure that the type of the `registry` field is satisfied.

Here's the proposed patch for the `registerHard` method:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes made are:

1. Replacing the `SortedMap` with a raw `Map` when retrieving the registry. This is because the raw type is compatible with both the old and new library versions.
2. Creating a new `TreeMap` with the same key-value pairs as the raw map and setting it to the registry. This ensures that the registry remains sorted as required by the `SortedMap` interface.

These changes ensure that the code works with both the old and new library versions.

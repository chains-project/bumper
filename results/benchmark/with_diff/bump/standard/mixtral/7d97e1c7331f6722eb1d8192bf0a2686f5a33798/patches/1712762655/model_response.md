Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:

```java
import static java.lang.String.format;
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.iterableWithSize;
import com.amazonaws.services.simpledb.model.SelectRequest;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

@Test
void selectsManyItems() {
    final com.jcabi.simpledb.Domain domain = this.domain();
    try {
        IntStream.range(0, 10)
            .forEach(idx -> domain.item(format("i-%d", idx)).put("hey", ""));
        SelectRequest request = new SelectRequest().withSelectExpression(format("SELECT * FROM `%s`", domain.name()))
            .withConsistentRead(true);
        assertThat(domain.select(request), iterableWithSize(10));
    } finally {
        domain.drop();
    }
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the usage of the `Tv` class with a Java 8 `IntStream` to generate a sequence of integers from 0 to 9. This avoids the need to import the `Tv` class, which was causing the "cannot find symbol" error. I've also simplified the loop that creates the items in the domain by using the `forEach` method of the `IntStream` class.

Note that I've also added the necessary import statements for the classes used in the patch.

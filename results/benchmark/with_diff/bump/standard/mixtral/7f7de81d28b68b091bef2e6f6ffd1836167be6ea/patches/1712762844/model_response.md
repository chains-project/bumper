Here's a fixed version of the `registerHard` method that should resolve the type mismatch error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

In this version, I've changed the type of the `reg` variable to `Map<MOScope, ManagedObject>` which is the common supertype of `SortedMap<MOScope, ManagedObject>`. This way, we avoid the type mismatch error.

Additionally, I've created a new `TreeMap` instance with the same key-value mappings as `reg` and passed it to the `registry.set` method. This is because the `server.getRegistry()` method returns a `SortedMap` instance, and the `registry` field of `server` is declared as a `SortedMap` as well. So, we need to pass a `SortedMap` instance to the `registry.set` method to avoid any potential issues.

Note that this solution assumes that the order of the map entries is not important for the application. If the order is important, you may need to find a different solution.

Here's a possible patch for the `registerHard` method that fixes the error:

```java
private void registerHard(final MOGroup group) {
    try {
        final Field registry = server.getClass().getDeclaredField("registry");
        registry.setAccessible(true);
        final Map<MOScope, ManagedObject> reg = server.getRegistry();
        DefaultMOContextScope contextScope = new DefaultMOContextScope(new OctetString(""), group.getScope());
        reg.put(contextScope, group);
        registry.set(server, new TreeMap<>(reg));
    } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException e) {
        log.warn("could not set server registry", e);
    }
}
```

The changes I made are:

1. I changed the type of the `reg` variable from `SortedMap` to `Map`, since the error message suggests that the former cannot be converted to the latter.
2. I created a new `TreeMap` from the `reg` map and set it as the new value of the `registry` field. This is because the `registry` field is expected to be a `SortedMap`, but the `Map` returned by `server.getRegistry()` cannot be directly cast to a `SortedMap`. By creating a new `TreeMap` from the `reg` map, we ensure that the registry remains sorted.

Note that these changes assume that the order of the entries in the registry is not important. If the order is important, then a different approach may be needed.

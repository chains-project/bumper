Here's the updated code that replaces the failing method. The main change is the import statement for `CertificationPermission`, which was moved to a different package:

```java
import eu.europa.esig.dss.pades.CertificationPermission;

public void signPdf(java.nio.file.Path pdfFile, java.nio.file.Path outputFile, byte[] keyStore, char[] keyStorePassword, boolean binary, SignatureParameters params) throws java.io.IOException {
    // ... (rest of the method code remains unchanged)
}
```

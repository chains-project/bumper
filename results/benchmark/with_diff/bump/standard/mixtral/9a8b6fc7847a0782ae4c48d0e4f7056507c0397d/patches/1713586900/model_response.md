Here is a possible patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PBEStringEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

// ...

TextEncryptor textEncryptor = new PBEStringEncryptor();
PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();
```
This patch replaces the missing `PBEPasswordEncoder` class with the `TextEncryptor` and `PasswordEncoder` classes from the updated library. The `PBEStringEncryptor` and `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` classes are used to provide similar functionality to the removed methods of `PBEPasswordEncoder`. Note that the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` class is used here as an example, and a different `PasswordEncoder` implementation may be more appropriate depending on the specific use case.

Here is a possible patch for the failing method in the client code:
```java
import org.jasypt.util.text.TextEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.PooledPBEStringEncryptor;
import org.jasypt.util.password.ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder;

//...

public class GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder {

    //...

    public PasswordEncoder createPasswordEncoder() {
        PooledPBEStringEncryptor encryptor = new PooledPBEStringEncryptor();
        encryptor.setPoolSize(POOL_SIZE);
        encryptor.setPassword(PASSWORD);
        encryptor.setAlgorithm(ALGORITHM);

        ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor passwordEncryptor = new ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor();
        passwordEncryptor.setAlgorithm(encryptor.getAlgorithm());
        passwordEncryptor.setPassword(encryptor.getPassword());
        passwordEncryptor.setKeyObtentionIterations(encryptor.getIterationCount());

        Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder();
        passwordEncoder.setPasswordEncryptor(passwordEncryptor);

        return passwordEncoder;
    }

    //...

}
```
This patch uses the `PooledPBEStringEncryptor` and `ConfigurablePasswordEncryptor` classes from the `org.jasypt.encryption.pbe` and `org.jasypt.util.password` packages, respectively, to create a `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` object from the `org.springframework.security.crypto.password` package.

The `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` object can then be used as a drop-in replacement for the `PBEPasswordEncoder` object that was used in the original code.

Note that this patch assumes that the `POOL_SIZE`, `PASSWORD`, and `ALGORITHM` constants are defined elsewhere in the `GeoStorePBEPasswordEncoder` class. You may need to modify these constants to match your specific requirements.

Also, note that this patch uses the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` class, which is a part of the Spring Security framework. If you are not using Spring Security in your application, you may need to use a different `PasswordEncoder` implementation.

Here's the fixed `between` method for the `DateTime` class:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This method is already correct. The error is caused by the change in the library version, where the `DateAndTime.between(Date, Date)` method has been removed and replaced with `DateAndTime.between(Timestamp, Timestamp)`. Since the `between` method in the `DateTime` class is already using `Timestamp`, there's no need to change it. The error message is misleading, and the real issue is caused by the library change.

However, if you want to "fix" the method to avoid potential issues in the future, you can change the method to use `Timestamp` instead of `Date`:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

This change ensures that the method is compatible with the new library version, but it may break compatibility with the old version if it's still being used. Make sure to test this change thoroughly and update other parts of the code accordingly.

Here is a fixed version of the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

// If the above code still doesn't work due to type incompatibility, try the following:

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).toInstant().toEpochMilli());
}
```

The original code fails because the `between` method of the superclass now returns a `java.sql.Timestamp` instead of a `java.util.Date`. The first version of the fixed code converts the `java.util.Date` returned by the superclass's `between` method to a `java.sql.Timestamp` using the `getTime` method.

The second version of the fixed code uses the `toInstant` method to convert the `java.util.Date` to a `java.time.Instant`, and then uses the `toEpochMilli` method to get the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. This number can then be used to create a new `java.sql.Timestamp` instance.

Note that the `Override` decorator has not been removed, since the `between` method is still overriding a method in the new version of the library.

Here's the proposed patch for the failing method:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlFrom = new Timestamp(from.getTime());
    java.sql.Timestamp sqlTo = new Timestamp(to.getTime());
    return new Timestamp(super.between(sqlFrom, sqlTo).getTime());
}
```

This patch converts the `Date` arguments to `Timestamp` using their respective `getTime()` method, and then calls the overloaded `between` method from the updated library version. The result is then converted back to `Timestamp`.

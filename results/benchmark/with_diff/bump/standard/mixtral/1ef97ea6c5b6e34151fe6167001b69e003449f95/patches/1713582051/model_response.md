Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

// Add the following method
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}
```

Explanation:

The original method takes two `Date` objects as arguments and returns a `Timestamp` object. However, the new library version has removed the `between` method that takes two `Date` objects as arguments. Therefore, we need to add a new method that takes two `Timestamp` objects as arguments and returns a `Timestamp` object.

We can still use the original method by converting the `Date` objects to `Timestamp` objects before calling the method. Therefore, we can keep the original method as it is and add the new method.

Note:

The new method has the same name and throws the same exception as the original method, but it takes different arguments and returns the same type. Therefore, it does not violate the requirement that we cannot change the function signature.

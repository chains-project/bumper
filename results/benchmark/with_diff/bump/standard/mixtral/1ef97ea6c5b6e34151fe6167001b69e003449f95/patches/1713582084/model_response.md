Here is the proposed patch:

```java
@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
}

private Timestamp convertDateToTimestamp(Date date) {
    return new Timestamp(date.getTime());
}

@Override
public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return convertDateToTimestamp(super.between(convertDateToTimestamp(from), convertDateToTimestamp(to)));
}
```

The patch converts the `Date` objects returned by the superclass method to `Timestamp` objects using a helper method. This allows the method to return a `Timestamp` object while still using the superclass method that takes `Date` objects as arguments.

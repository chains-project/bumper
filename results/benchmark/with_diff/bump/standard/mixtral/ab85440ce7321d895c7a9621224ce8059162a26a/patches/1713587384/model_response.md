Here is the patched method using a different Hamcrest matcher that should fix the error:

```java
private static org.hamcrest.Matcher<java.lang.String> imagePulled(final java.lang.String image) {
    return new org.hamcrest.core.StringStartsWith(java.lang.String.format("Status: Downloaded newer image for %s", image));
}
```
The error was caused by the use of the `StringContains` matcher, which expects a substring argument, but was passed a format string instead. The new matcher `StringStartsWith` checks if a string starts with a given prefix, which is more appropriate in this case.

Here's the proposed patch:

```java
@java.lang.Override
public void init(java.io.OutputStream os) {
    this.os = os;
    // Use the TFlushingFastFramedTransport to be compatible with singer_thrift log.
    final int bufferCapacity = 10;
    TConfiguration tConfig = new TConfiguration();
    TIOStreamTransport transport = new TIOStreamTransport(tConfig, os);
    framedTransport = new TFastFramedTransport(transport, bufferCapacity);
    protocol = new TBinaryProtocol(framedTransport);
}
```

In this patch, I've replaced the `TIOStreamTransport` constructor with the new one that takes a `TConfiguration` object. This constructor is marked as `++` in the library changes, indicating that it has been added. I then use this `TIOStreamTransport` object to create a `TFastFramedTransport` object, which is marked as `++` in the library changes. This allows us to use the `TFastFramedTransport` class even though it is not directly available in the client code.

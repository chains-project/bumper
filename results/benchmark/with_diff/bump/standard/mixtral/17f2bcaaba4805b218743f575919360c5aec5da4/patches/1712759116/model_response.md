Here's a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import micycle.pgs.annotations.Ignore; // Add this import statement

@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
@micycle.pgs.annotations.Ignore // Use the fully qualified name here
void testRobustnessRandomly() {
    // ... Rest of the code remains unchanged ...
}
```
The error message suggests that the `@Ignore` annotation cannot be found, which is likely due to a missing or incorrect import statement. Since the annotation is part of the same package as the test class, you can import it using the fully qualified name.

Note: I cannot test the patched code, so you might need to adjust it accordingly.

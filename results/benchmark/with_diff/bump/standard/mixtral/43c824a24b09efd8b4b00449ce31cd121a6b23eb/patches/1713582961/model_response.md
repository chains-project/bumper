Here's a fixed version of the `extractFirst` method that should resolve the error:

```java
private static java.lang.String extractFirst(de.gwdg.metadataqa.api.model.pathcache.JsonPathCache cache, Object branch) {
    java.util.List<java.lang.String> list = de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.MarcFactory.extractList(cache, branch);
    if (!list.isEmpty())
        return list.get(0);

    return null;
}
```

In the original code, `JsonBranch` is used as the type for the `branch` parameter. However, based on the error message, it seems that `JsonBranch` has been removed in the new library version. Instead, we can use the more general `Object` type for the `branch` parameter. This allows us to pass any object as the second argument to the `extractList` method, which should resolve the error.

Here's a patch that you can apply to the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.io.StringWriter;

// ...

String outputName = renderingContext.getOutputName();
StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();
renderingContext.setOutput(stringWriter);

// ... (use renderingContext and stringWriter as needed)

// Get the rendered content
String renderedContent = stringWriter.toString();
```
In this patch, we've imported the new `RenderingContext` class and used it to render the content to a `StringWriter`. Note that the `getOutputName()` method has been added, so we can get the output name before setting the output.

After rendering the content, you can get the rendered content from the `StringWriter`. Make sure to replace any existing usage of the removed methods with the new approach.

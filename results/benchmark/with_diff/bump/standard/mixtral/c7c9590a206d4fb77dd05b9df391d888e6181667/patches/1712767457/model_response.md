Here is a possible patch for the failing method in the client code:

```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.SiteRenderingContext;

//...

public void someMethod(Writer writer, RenderingContext renderingContext, SiteRenderingContext siteRenderingContext) {
    String outputName = renderingContext.getOutputName();
    //... use outputName further in the method
}
```

This patch imports the new `getOutputName()` method from the `RenderingContext` class, which was added in the new library version. It then uses this method to get the output name of the rendering context and stores it in a local variable `outputName`. This variable can then be used in the method as needed. Note that the `RenderingContext` class is still imported from the same package as before, but the import statement has been updated to reflect the new class name.

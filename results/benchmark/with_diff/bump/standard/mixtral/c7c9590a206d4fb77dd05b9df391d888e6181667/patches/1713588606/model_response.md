Here's the proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.io.StringWriter;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement based on the original usage of RenderingContext
        // in the client code.
    }
};

StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();

// Use the new renderingContext and stringWriter objects
// in place of the original RenderingContext and Writer objects.
```
The patch creates a new anonymous class extending `RenderingContext` and overrides the `getOutputName()` method. The original usage of `RenderingContext` in the client code should be updated to use this new object. Additionally, a `StringWriter` is created for writing the output. The new `renderingContext` and `stringWriter` objects should be used in place of the original `RenderingContext` and `Writer` objects.

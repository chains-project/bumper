Here's a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.io.StringWriter;

// ...

StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        // Implement the method according to your needs
        return "output";
    }
};

// Use renderingContext and writer in your code
```
This patch introduces a `StringWriter` to replace the missing `Writer` parameter in the removed method. It also creates a custom implementation of `RenderingContext` that only overrides the newly added `getOutputName()` method. You should implement the method according to your specific needs.

Please note that this patch assumes that the rest of the code can work without the removed methods. If that's not the case, you might need to adapt the patch accordingly.

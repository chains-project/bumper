Here is a possible patch for the client code:
```java
import org.apache.maven.doxia.siterenderer.RenderingContext;
import java.io.StringWriter;

// ...

RenderingContext renderingContext = new RenderingContext() {
    @Override
    public String getOutputName() {
        return "xhtml";
    }
};

StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
renderer.renderDocument(writer, renderingContext, siteRenderingContext);
```
This code creates a new `RenderingContext` object by subclassing it and overriding the `getOutputName()` method to return the string `"xhtml"`. This is necessary because the `renderDocument()` method now expects a `RenderingContext` object with a non-null `outputName`.

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the `renderer` and `siteRenderingContext` variables, as they were not defined in the code snippet you provided. You may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Here is a proposed patch for the failing client code:
```java
import com.jcabi.github.Tv; // added import statement

/**
 * Create repo with random name.
 *
 * @return Repo
 * @throws IOException
 * 		If fails
 */
public com.jcabi.github.Repo randomRepo() throws java.io.IOException {
    return this.repos().create(new com.jcabi.github.Repos.RepoCreate(org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(Tv.TWENTY), true));
}
```
In the new library version, the class `Tv` has been removed, but the constant `TWENTY` has been added as a static field to the class. Therefore, we need to add an import statement for `com.jcabi.github.Tv` at the beginning of the file, and the code should compile and run successfully.

the following code fails: 
```java
  @Override
  public Timestamp between(Date from, Date to) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    return new Timestamp(super.between(from, to).getTime());
  }
```

you have the following insights: 
CI detected that the dependency upgrade from version datafaker-1.3.0 to datafaker-1.4.0 has failed. Here are details to help you understand and fix the problem:

Your client utilizes the instruction between which has been modified in the new version of the dependency.
The failure is identified from the logs generated in the build process
[ERROR] /flink-faker/src/main/java/com/github/knaufk/flink/faker/DateTime.java:[45,40] incompatible types: java.util.Date cannot be converted to java.sql.Timestamp.

An error was detected in line 45 which is making use of an outdated API.
45   super.between(from, to);

the new library version defines the function `between` as:
public Timestamp between(Timestamp from, Timestamp to)

propose a patch that i can apply to the code in order to fix the error

act as a senior software engineer, your goal is fix code failures.
You are specialized in breaking dependency updates, in which the failure is caused by an external dependency.
To solve the failure you can only work on the client code.

the following client code fails:
```java
{{ client_code }}
```

with the following error message:
{{ error_message }}

the new library version includes the following changes:
{{ bump_description }}

you also know that the failing method is inserted in this class:
```java
{{ in_class_client_code }}
```

propose a patch that I can apply to the code in order to fix the error.
Your response will be automatically parsed by an algorithm, be sure to only return the code.
you CANNOT change the function signature, but you can create variables if they help to make the code easier to understand.
return only the fixed failing method, not the complete class code.
